Abstract#==#In this paper, we address the automatic induction of synonym
  paraphrases for the empirically challenging class of German particle
  verbs. Similarly to Cocos and Callison-Burch (2016), we incorporate
  a graph-based clustering approach for word sense discrimination into
  an existing paraphrase extraction system, (i) to improve the
  precision of synonym identification and ranking, and (ii) to enlarge
  the diversity of synonym senses. Our approach significantly improves
  over the standard system, but does not outperform an extended
  baseline integrating a simple distributional similarity measure.
