Abstract#==#Recent works in Natural Language Processing (NLP) using neural networks have
focused on learning dense word representations to perform classification tasks.
When dealing with phrase prediction problems, is is common practice to use
special tagging schemes to identify segments boundaries. This allows these
tasks to be expressed as common word tagging problems. In this paper, we
propose to learn fixed-size representations for arbitrarily sized chunks. We
introduce a model that takes advantage of such representations to perform
phrase tagging by directly identifying and classifying phrases. We evaluate our
approach on the task of multiword expression (MWE) tagging and show that our
model outperforms the state-of-the-art model for this task.
