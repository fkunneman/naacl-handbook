Abstract#==#This paper presents FrameNet’s approach to the representation of Support
Verbs, as one type of multiword expression (MWE) included in the database. In
addition to motivating and illustrating FrameNet’s newly consistent
annotation practice for Support Verb constructions, this work advocates
adopting a broad view of what constitutes a multiword expression.
