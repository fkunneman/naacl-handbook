Abstract#==#This study aims at determining whether collocational features automatically
extracted from EFL (English as a foreign language) texts are useful for quality
scoring, and allow the improvement of a competitive baseline based on, amongst
other factors, bigram frequencies. The collocational features were gathered by
assigning to each bigram in an EFL text eight association scores computed on
the basis of a native reference corpus. The distribution of the association
scores were then summarized by a few global statistical features and by a
discretizing procedure. An experiment conducted on a publicly available dataset
confirmed the effectiveness of these features and the benefit brought by using
several discretized association scores.
