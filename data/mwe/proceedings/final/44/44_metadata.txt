Abstract#==#Verb-noun idiomatic combinations (VNICs) are idioms consisting of a verb with a
noun in its direct object position. Usages of these expressions can be
ambiguous between an idiomatic usage and a literal combination. In this paper
we propose supervised and unsupervised approaches, based on word embeddings, to
identifying token instances of VNICs. Our proposed supervised and unsupervised
approaches perform better than the supervised and unsupervised approaches of
Fazly et
al. (2009), respectively.
