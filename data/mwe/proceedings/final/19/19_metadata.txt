Abstract#==#In this paper, we demonstrate the impact of Multiword Expression (MWE)
resources in the task of MWE recognition in text. We present results based on
the Wiki50 corpus for MWE resources, generated using unsupervised methods from
raw text and resources that are extracted using manual text markup and lexical
resources. We show that resources acquired from manual annotation yield the
best MWE tagging performance. However, a more fine-grained analysis that
differentiates MWEs according to their part of speech (POS) reveals that
automatically acquired MWE lists outperform the resources generated from human
knowledge for three out of four classes.
