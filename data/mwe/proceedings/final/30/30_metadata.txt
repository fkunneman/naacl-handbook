Abstract#==#Linguistic resources for Polish are often missing multiword expressions (MWEs)
-- idioms, compound nouns and other expressions which have their own distinct
meaning as a whole. This paper describes an effort to extract and recognize
nominal MWEs in Polish text using Wikipedia, inflection dictionaries and
finite-state automata. Wikipedia is used as a lexicon of MWEs and as a corpus
annotated with links to articles. Incoming links for each article are used to
determine the inflection pattern of the headword -- this approach helps
eliminate invalid inflected forms. The goal is to recognize known MWEs as well
as to find more expressions sharing similar grammatical structure and occurring
in similar context.
