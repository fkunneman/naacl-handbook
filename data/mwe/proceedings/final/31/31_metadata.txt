Abstract#==#Non-substitutability is a property of Multiword Expressions (MWEs) that often
causes lexical rigidity and is relevant for most types of MWEs. Efficient
identification of this property can result in the efficient identification of
MWEs. In this work we propose using distributional semantics, in the form of
word embeddings, to identify candidate substitutions for a candidate MWE and
model its substitutability. We use our models to rank MWEs based on their
lexical rigidity and study their performance in comparison with association
measures. We also study the interaction between our models and association
measures. We show that one of our models can significantly improve over the
association measure baselines, identifying collocations.
