Abstract#==#In this paper we present a study on the production of collocations by students
of European Portuguese as a foreign language. We start by gathering several
corpora written by students, and identify the correct and incorrect
collocations. We annotate the latter considering several different aspects,
such as the error location, description and explanation. Then, taking these
elements into consideration, we compare the performance of students considering
their levels of proficiency, their mother tongue and, also, other languages
they know. Finally, we correct all the students productions and contribute with
a corpus of everyday language collocations that can be helpful in Portuguese
classes.
