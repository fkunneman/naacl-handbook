Abstract#==#The paper presents an empirical study of integrating ngrams and multi-word
terms into topic models, while maintaining similarities between them and words
based on their component structure. First, we adapt the PLSA-SIM algorithm to
the more widespread LDA model and ngrams. Then we propose a novel algorithm
LDA-ITER that allows the incorporation of the most suitable ngrams into topic
models. The experiments of integrating ngrams and multi-word terms conducted on
five text collections in different languages and domains demonstrate a
significant improvement in all the metrics under consideration.
