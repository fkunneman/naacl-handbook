Abstract#==#In this work we carried out an idiom type identification task on a set of 90
Italian V-NP and V-PP constructions comprising both idioms and non-idioms.
Lexical variants were generated from these expressions by replacing their
components with semantically related words extracted distributionally and from
the Italian section of MultiWordNet. Idiomatic phrases turned out to be less
similar to their lexical variants with respect to non-idiomatic ones in
distributional semantic spaces. Different variant-based distributional measures
of idiomaticity were tested. Our indices proved reliable in identifying also
those idioms whose lexical variants are poorly or not at all attested in our
corpus.
