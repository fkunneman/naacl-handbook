Abstract#==#In this paper, we  investigate the impact of context for the paraphrase ranking
task, comparing and quantifying results for multiword expressions and single
words. We focus on systematic integration of existing paraphrase resources to
produce paraphrase candidates and later ask human annotators to judge
paraphrasability in context. 

We first conduct a paraphrase-scoring annotation task with and without context
for targets that are i) single- and multi-word expressions ii) verbs and nouns.
We quantify how differently annotators score paraphrases when context
information is provided. Furthermore, we report on experiments with automatic
paraphrase ranking. If we regard the problem as a binary classification
task, we obtain an F1--score of 81.56% and 79.87% for multiword expressions
and single words resp. using kNN classifier. Approaching the problem as a
learning-to-rank task, we attain MAP scores up to 87.14%  and 91.58% for
multiword expressions and single words resp.  using LambdaMART, thus yielding
high-quality contextualized paraphrased selection. Further, we provide the
first dataset with paraphrase judgments for multiword targets in context.
