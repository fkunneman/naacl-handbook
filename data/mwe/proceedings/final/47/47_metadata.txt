Abstract#==#This paper analyzes datasets with numerical scores that quantify the semantic
compositionality of MWEs. We present the results of our analysis of
crowdsourced compositionality judgments for noun compounds in three languages.
Our goals are to look at the characteristics of the annotations in different
languages; to examine intrinsic quality measures for such data; and to measure
the impact of filters proposed in the literature on these measures. The
cross-lingual results suggest that greater agreement is found for the extremes
in the compositionality scale, and that outlier annotation removal is more
effective than outlier annotator
removal.
