Abstract#==#This paper describes results of a study related to the PARSEME Shared Task on
automatic detection of verbal Multi-Word Expressions (MWEs) which focuses on
their identification in running texts in many languages. The Shared Task's
organizers have provided basic annotation guidelines where four basic types of
verbal MWEs are defined including some specific subtypes. Czech is among the
twenty languages selected for the task. We will contribute to the Shared Task
dataset,  a multilingual open resource, by converting data from the Prague
Dependency Treebank (PDT) to the Shared Task format. The question to answer is
to which extent this can be done automatically. In this paper, we concentrate
on one of the relevant MWE categories, namely on the quasi-universal category
called ``Inherently Pronominal Verbs'' (IPronV) and describe its annotation in
the Prague Dependency Treebank. After comparing it to the Shared Task
guidelines, we can conclude that the PDT and the associated valency lexicon,
PDT-Vallex, contain sufficient information for the conversion, even if some
specific instances will have to be checked.  As a side effect, we have
identified certain errors in PDT annotation which can now be corrected.
