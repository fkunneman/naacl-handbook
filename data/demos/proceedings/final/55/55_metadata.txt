Abstract#==#We present TMop, the first open-source tool for automatic Translation Memory
(TM) cleaning. The tool implements a fully unsupervised approach to the task,
which allows spotting unreliable translation units (sentence pairs in different
languages, which are supposed to be translations of each other) without
requiring labeled training data. TMop includes a highly configurable and
extensible set of filters capturing different aspects of translation quality.
It has been evaluated on a test set composed of 1,000 translation units (TUs)
randomly extracted from the English-Italian version of MyMemory, a large-scale
public TM. Results indicate its effectiveness in automatic removing “bad”
TUs, with comparable performance to a state-of-the-art supervised method (76.3
vs. 77.7 balanced accuracy).
