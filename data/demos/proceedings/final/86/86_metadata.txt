Abstract#==#Boulder Learning has developed and evaluated a conversational multimedia
virtual tutor for elementary school science. The operating principles for the
tutor are grounded on research from education and cognitive science. This
virtual science tutor is unique in that it engages children in spoken dialogs
in which they learn to construct explanations of science phenomena presented in
illustrations, animations and interactive simulations. Summative evaluations
indicate that students are highly engaged in the tutoring sessions, and achieve
learning outcomes equivalent to expert human tutors. Tutorials are developed
through a process of recording and annotating data from sessions with students,
and then updating tutor models. In initial evaluations, My Science Tutor (MyST)
has been shown to produce significant learning gains with effect size d=0.53
compared to controls. It is enthusiastically supported by students and
teachers. Teachers report that it is feasible to integrate into their
curriculum.
