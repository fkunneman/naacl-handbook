Abstract
We present pigeo, a Python geolocation
prediction tool that predicts a location for
a given text input or Twitter user. We dis-
cuss the design, implementation and appli-
cation of pigeo, and empirically evaluate
it. pigeo is able to geolocate informal
text and is a very useful tool for users who
require a free and easy-to-use, yet accurate
geolocation service based on pre-trained
models. Additionally, users can train their
own models easily using pigeoâ€™s API.
