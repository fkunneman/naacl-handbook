Abstract#==#The reading material used in a language learning classroom should ideally be
rich in terms of the grammatical constructions and vocabulary to be taught and
in line with the learner's interests. We developed an online Information
Retrieval system that helps teachers search for texts appropriate in form,
content, and reading level. It identifies the 87 grammatical constructions
spelled out in the official English language curriculum of schools in
Baden-Württemberg, Germany. The tool incorporates a classical efficient
algorithm for reranking the results by assigning weights to selected
constructions and prioritizing the documents containing them. Supplemented by
an interactive visualization module, it allows for a multi-faceted presentation
and analysis of the retrieved documents.
