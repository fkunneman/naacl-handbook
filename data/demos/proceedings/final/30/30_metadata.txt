Abstract#==#Semantic role labeling (SRL) identifies the predicate-argument structure in
text with semantic labels. It plays a key role in understanding natural
language. In this paper, we present POLYGLOT, a multilingual semantic role
labeling system capable of semantically parsing sentences in 9 different
languages from 4 different language groups. The core of POLYGLOT are SRL models
for individual languages trained with automatically generated Proposition Banks
(Akbik et al., 2015). The key feature of the system is that it treats the
semantic labels of the English Proposition Bank as “universal semantic
labels”: Given a sentence in any of the supported languages, POLYGLOT applies
the corresponding SRL and predicts English PropBank frame and role annotation.
The results are then visualized to facilitate the understanding of multilingual
SRL with this unified semantic representation.
