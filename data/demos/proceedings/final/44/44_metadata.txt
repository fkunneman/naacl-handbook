Abstract#==#We introduce MediaGist, an online system for crosslingual analysis of
aggregated news and commentaries based on summarization and sentiment analysis
technologies. 
It is designed to assist journalists to detect and explore news topics, which
are controversially reported or discussed in different countries.
News articles from current week are clustered separately in currently 5
languages and the clusters are then linked across languages. 
Sentiment analysis provides a basis to compute controversy scores and summaries
help to explore the differences.
Recognized entities play an important role in most of the system's modules and
provide another way to explore the data.
We demonstrate the capabilities of MediaGist by listing highlights from the
last week and present a rough evaluation of the system.
