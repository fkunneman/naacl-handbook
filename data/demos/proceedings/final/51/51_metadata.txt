Abstract#==#In our media-driven world the perception of companies and institutions in the
media is of major importance. The creation of press reviews analyzing the media
response to company-related events is a complex and time-consuming task. In
this demo we present a system that combines advanced text-mining and machine
learning approaches in an extensible press review system. The system collects
documents from heterogeneous sources and enriches the documents applying
different mining, filtering, classification, and aggregation algorithms. We
present a system tailored to the needs of the press department of a major
German University. We explain how the different components have been trained
and evaluated. The system enables us demonstrating the live analyzes of news
and social media streams as well as the strength of advanced text-mining
algorithms for creating a comprehensive media analysis.
