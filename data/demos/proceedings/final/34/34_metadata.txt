Abstract#==#We present a new release of OpenDial, an open-source toolkit for building and
evaluating spoken dialogue systems. The toolkit relies on an information-state
architecture where the dialogue state is represented as a Bayesian network and
acts as a shared memory for all system modules. The domain models are specified
via probabilistic rules encoded in XML. OpenDial has been deployed in several
application domains such as human-robot interaction, intelligent tutoring
systems and multi-modal in-car driver assistants.
