Abstract#==#In this paper, we present Roleo, a web tool for visualizing the vector
spaces generated by the evaluation of distributional memory (DM)
models over thematic fit judgements.  A thematic fit judgement is a
rating of the selectional preference of a verb for an argument that
fills a given thematic role.  The DM approach to thematic fit
judgements involves the construction of a sub-space in which a
prototypical role-filler can be built for comparison to the noun being
judged.  We describe a publicly-accessible web tool that allows for
querying and exploring these spaces as well as a technique for
visualizing thematic fit sub-spaces efficiently for web use.
