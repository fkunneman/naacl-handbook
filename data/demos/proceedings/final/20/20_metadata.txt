Abstract#==#Current education standards in the U.S. require school students to read and
understand complex texts from different subject areas (e.g., social studies).
However, such texts usually contain figurative language, complex phrases and
sentences, as well as unfamiliar discourse relations. This may present an
obstacle to students whose native language is not English -- a growing
sub-population in the US. One way to help such students is to create classroom
activities centered around linguistic elements found in subject area texts
(DelliCarpini, 2008). We present a web-based tool that uses NLP algorithms to
automatically generate customizable linguistic activities that are grounded in
language learning research.
