Abstract#==#Despite the abundance of biomedical literature and health discussions in online
communities, it is often tedious to retrieve informative contents for
health-centric information needs. Users can query scholarly work in PubMed by
keywords and MeSH terms, and resort to Google for everything else. This demo
paper presents the DeepLife system, to overcome the limitations of
existing search engines for life science and health topics. DeepLife integrates
large knowledge bases and harnesses entity linking methods, to support search
and exploration of scientific literature, newspaper feeds, and social media, in
terms of keywords and phrases, biomedical
entities, and taxonomic categories. It also provides functionality for
entity-aware text analytics over health-centric contents.
