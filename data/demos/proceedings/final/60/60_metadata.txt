Abstract#==#The MUSEEC (MUltilingual SEntence Extraction and Compression) summarization
tool implements several extractive summarization techniques – at the level of
complete and compressed sentences – that can be applied, with some minor
adaptations, to documents in multiple languages.
The current version of MUSEEC provides the following summarization methods:
(1) MUSE – a supervised summarizer, based on a genetic algorithm (GA),
that ranks document sentences and extracts top–ranking sentences into a
summary, (2) POLY – an unsupervised summarizer, based on linear programming
(LP), that selects the best extract of document sentences, and (3) WECOM – an
unsupervised extension of POLY that compiles a document summary from compressed
sentences. In this paper, we provide an overview of MUSEEC methods
and its architecture in general.
