Abstract#==#We introduce GoWvis, an interactive web application that represents any piece
of text inputted by the user as a graph-of-words and leverages graph degeneracy
and community detection to generate an extractive summary (keyphrases and
sentences) of the inputted text in an unsupervised fashion. The entire analysis
can be fully customized via the tuning of many text preprocessing, graph
building, and graph mining parameters. Our system is thus well suited to
educational purposes, exploration and early research experiments. The new
summarization strategy we propose also shows promise.
