Abstract#==#We present a computer-assisted language learning (CALL) system that generates
fill-in-the-blank items for preposition usage.                          The system
takes a
set of
carrier sentences as input, chooses a preposition in each sentence as the key,
and then automatically generates distractors.  It personalizes item selection
for the user in two ways.  First, it logs items to which the user previously
gave incorrect answers, and offers similar items in a future session as review.
 Second, it progresses from easier to harder sentences, to minimize any
hindrance on preposition learning that might be posed by difficult vocabulary.
