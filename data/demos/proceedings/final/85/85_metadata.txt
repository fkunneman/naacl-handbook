Abstract#==#We present a prototype of a novel technology for second language instruction.
Our learn-by-reading approach lets a human learner acquire new words and
constructions by encountering them in context. To facilitate reading
comprehension, our technology presents mixed native language (L1) and second
language (L2) sentences to a learner and allows them to interact with the
sentences to make the sentences easier (more L1-like) or harder (more L2-like)
to read. Eventually, our system should continuously track a learner's
knowledge and learning style by modeling their interactions, including
performance on a pop quiz feature. This will allow our system to generate
personalized mixed-language texts for learners.
