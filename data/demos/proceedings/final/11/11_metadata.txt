Abstract#==#We introduce, TermSuite, a  JAVA and UIMA-based toolkit to build
terminologies from corpora. TermSuite follows the classic two steps of
terminology extraction tools, the identification of term candidates and their
ranking, but implements new features. It is multilingually designed, scalable,
and handles term variants. We focus on the main components: UIMA Token RegExp
for defining term and variant patterns over word annotations, and the grouping
component for clustering terms and variants that works both at morphological
and syntactic levels.
