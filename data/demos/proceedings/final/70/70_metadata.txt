Abstract#==#The current release of ODIN (Online Database of Interlinear Text) contains over
150,000 linguistic examples, from nearly 1,500 languages, extracted from PDFs
found on the web, representing a significant source of data for language
research, particularly for low-resource languages. Errors during PDF-to-text
conversion or poorly formatted examples can make the task of automatically
analyzing the data more difficult, so we aim to clean and normalize the
examples in order to maximize accuracy during analysis. In this paper we
describe a system that allows users to automatically and manually correct
errors in the source data in order to get the best possible analysis of the
data. We also describe a RESTful service for managing collections of linguistic
examples on the web. All software is distributed under an open-source license.
