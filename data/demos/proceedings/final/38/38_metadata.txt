Abstract#==#Freebase contains entities and relation information but is highly incomplete.  
Relevant information is ubiquitous in web text, but extraction deems
challenging.

We present JEDI, an automated system to jointly extract typed named entities
and Freebase relations using dependency pattern from text. An innovative method
for constraint solving on entity types of multiple
relations is used to disambiguate pattern.

The high precision in the evaluation supports our claim that we can detect
entities and relations together, alleviating the need to train a custom
classifier for an entity type.
