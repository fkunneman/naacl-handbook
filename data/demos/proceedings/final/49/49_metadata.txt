Abstract#==#MeTA is developed to unite machine
learning, information retrieval, and natural language processing in one
easy-to-use
toolkit. Its focus on indexing allows it to
perform well on large datasets, supporting
online classification and other out-of-core
algorithms. MeTAs liberal open source
license encourages contributions, and its
extensive online documentation, forum,
and tutorials make this process straightforward. We run experiments and show
MeTA's performance is competitive with
or better than existing software.
