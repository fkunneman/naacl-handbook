Abstract#==#We present Jigg, a Scala (or JVM-based) NLP annotation pipeline framework,
which is easy to use and is extensible. Jigg supports a very simple interface
similar to Stanford CoreNLP, the most successful NLP pipeline toolkit, but has
more flexibility to adapt to new types of annotation. On this framework, system
developers can easily integrate their downstream system into a NLP pipeline
from a raw text by just preparing a wrapper of it.
