Abstract#==#Publicly available knowledge repositories, such as Wikipedia and Freebase,
benefit
significantly from volunteers, whose contributions ensure that the knowledge
keeps
expanding and is kept up-to-date and accurate. User interactions are often
limited to
hypertext, tabular, or graph visualization interfaces. 
For spatio-temporal information, however, other interaction paradigms may
be better-suited. We present an integrated system that combines crowdsourcing,
automatic or semi-automatic knowledge harvesting from text, and visual
analytics. It
enables users to analyze large quantities of structured data and unstructured
textual
data from a spatio-temporal perspective and gain deep insights that are not
easily
observed in individual facts.
