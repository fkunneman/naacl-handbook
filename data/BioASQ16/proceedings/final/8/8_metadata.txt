Abstract#==#This paper describes the OAQA system evaluated in the BioASQ 4B Question
Answering track. The system extends the Yang et al. (2015) system and
integrates additional biomedical and general-purpose NLP annotators, machine
learning modules for search result scoring, collective answer reranking, and
yes/no answer prediction. We first present the overall architecture of the
system, and then focus on describing the main extensions to the Yang et al.
(2015) approach. Before the official evaluation, we used the development
dataset (excluding the 3B Batch 5 subset) for training. We present initial
evaluation results on a subset of the development data set to demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed new methods, and focus on performance analysis of
yes/no question answering.
