Abstract#==#The goal of this task is to push the research frontier towards hybrid
information systems. We aim to promote systems and approaches that are able to
deal with the whole diversity of the Web, especially for, but not restricted
to, the context of bio-medicine.  This goal is pursued by the organization of
challenges. The fourth challenge, as the previous challenges, consisted of two
tasks: semantic indexing and question answering. 16 systems participated by 7
different participating teams for the semantic indexing task. The question
answering task was tackled by 37 different systems, developed by 11 different
teams.                                            25 of the systems participated in
the
phase A
of the
task,
while
12
participated in phase B. 3 of the teams participated in both phases of the
question answering task. Overall, as in previous years, the best systems were
able to outperform the strong baselines. This suggests that advances over the
state of the art were achieved through the \bioasq challenge but also that the
benchmark in itself is very challenging. In this paper, we present the data
used during the challenge as well as the technologies which were at the core of
the participants' frameworks.
