Abstract#==#We present the methods and approaches employed in terms of our participation in
the 2016 version of the BioASQ challenge. For the semantic indexing task, we
extended our successful ensemble approach of last year with additional models.
The official results obtained so-far demonstrate a continuing consistent
advantage of our approaches against the National Library of Medicine (NLM)
baselines. For the question answering task, we extended our approach on factoid
questions, while we also developed approaches for the document, concept and
snippet retrieval sub-tasks.
