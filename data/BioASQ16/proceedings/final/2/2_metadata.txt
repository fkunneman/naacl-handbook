Abstract#==#For almost 15 years, the NLM Medical Text Indexer (MTI) system has been
providing assistance to NLM Indexers, Catalogers, and the History of Medicine
Division (HMD) in the task of indexing              the ever increasing number of
MEDLINE
citations, with MTI's  role continuously expanding by providing more extensive
and specialized coverage of the MEDLINE collection. The BioASQ Challenge has
been a tremendous benefit by expanding the knowledge of leading-edge indexing
research. In this paper we present an indexing approach based on the Learning
to Rank methodology which was successfully applied to the indexing task by
several participants of recent Challenges. The proposed solution is designed to
enhance the results that come from MTI by combining strengths of MTI with
additional sources of evidence to produce a more accurate list of top MeSH
Heading candidates for a MEDLINE citation being indexed. It incorporates novel
Learning to Rank features and other enhancements to produce performance
superior to that of MTI, both overall and for two specific classes of MeSH
Headings for which MTI has shown poor performance.
