Abstract#==#Quantitative analysis of human brain activity based on language
representations, such as the semantic categories of words, have been actively
studied in the field of brain and neuroscience. Our study aims to generate
natural language descriptions for human brain activation phenomena caused by
visual stimulus by employing deep learning methods, which have gained interest
as an effective approach to automatically describe natural language expressions
for various type of multi-modal information, such as images. We employed an
image-captioning system based on a deep learning framework as the basis for our
method by learning the relationship between the brain activity data and the
features of an intermediate expression of the deep neural network owing to lack
of training brain data. We conducted three experiments and were able to
generate natural language sentences which enabled us to quantitatively
interpret brain activity.
