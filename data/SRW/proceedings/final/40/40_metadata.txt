Abstract#==#The availability of large document-summary corpora have opened up new
possibilities for using statistical text generation techniques for abstractive
summarization. Progress in Extractive text summarization has become stagnant
for a while now and in this work we compare the two possible alternates to it.
We present an argument in favor of abstractive summarization compared to an
ensemble of extractive techniques. Further we explore the possibility of using
statistical machine translation as a generative text summarization technique
and present possible research questions in this direction. We also report our
initial findings and future direction of research.
