Abstract#==#Singleton (or non-coreferential) mentions are a problem for coreference
resolution systems, and identifying singletons before mentions are linked
improves resolution performance. Here, a singleton detection system based on
word embeddings and neural networks is presented, which achieves
state-of-the-art performance (79.6% accuracy) on the CoNLL-2012 shared task
development set. Extrinsic evaluation with the Stanford and Berkeley
coreference resolution systems shows significant improvement for the first, but
not for the latter. The results show the potential of using neural networks and
word embeddings for improving both singleton detection and coreference
resolution.
