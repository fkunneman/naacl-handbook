Abstract#==#We present a new, sizeable dataset of noun--noun compounds with their syntactic
analysis (bracketing) and semantic relations. Derived from several established
linguistic resources, such as the Penn Treebank, our dataset enables
experimenting with new approaches towards a holistic analysis of noun--noun
compounds, such as joint-learning of noun--noun compounds bracketing and
interpretation, as well as integrating compound analysis with other tasks such
as syntactic parsing.
