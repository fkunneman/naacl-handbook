Abstract#==#The idea behind this proposal is to investigate the possibility of utilizing
NLP tools, statistical topic modelling techniques and freely available online
resources to propose a system able to provide dialogue contribution suggestions
which are relevant to the context, yet out of the main activity of the dialogue
(i.e. off-activity talk). The aim is to evaluate the effects of a tool that
automatically suggests off-activity talks in form of some sentences relevant to
the dialogue context. The evaluation is to be done over two test-sets of open
domain and closed-domain in a conversational quiz-like setting. The outcome of
this work will be a satisfactory point of entry to investigate the hypothesis
that adding automatically generated off-activity talks feature to a
conversational agent can lead to building up engagement of the dialogue
partner(s).
