Abstract#==#Online newspaper articles can accumulate comments at volumes that prevent close
reading. Summarisation of the comments allows interaction at a higher level and
can lead to an understanding of the overall discussion. Comment summarisation
requires topic clustering, comment ranking and extraction. Clustering must be
robust as the subsequent extraction relies on a good set of clusters. Comment
data, as with many social media datasets, contains very short documents and the
number of words in the documents is a limiting factors on the performance of
LDA clustering. We evaluate whether we can combine comments to form larger
documents to improve the quality of clusters. We find that combining comments
with comments that reply to them produce the highest quality clusters.
