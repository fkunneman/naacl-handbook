Abstract#==#In this paper, we propose a cross-lingual convolutional neural network (CNN)
model that is based on word and phrase embeddings learned from unlabeled data
in two languages and dependency gram- mar. Compared to traditional machine
translation (MT) based methods for cross lingual sentence modeling, our model
is much simpler and does not need parallel corpora or language specific
features. We only use a bilingual dictionary and dependency parser. This makes
our model particularly appealing for resource poor languages. We evaluate our
model using English and Chinese data on several sentence classification tasks.
We show that our model achieves a comparable and even better performance than
the traditional MT-based method.
