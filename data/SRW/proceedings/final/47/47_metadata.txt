Abstract#==#Sarcasm can radically alter or invert a phrase's meaning. Sarcasm detection can
therefore help improve natural language processing (NLP) tasks.
However, the majority of prior research has treated sarcasm detection as 
classification, with three important limitations:  
1. Balanced datasets, when sarcasm is actually rather rare. 
2. Using Twitter users' self-declarations in the form of hashtags to label
data, when sarcasm can take many forms. 
To address these issues, we create an unbalanced corpus of manually annotated
Twitter conversations. We compare human and machine ability to recognize
sarcasm on this data under varying amounts of context. 
Results indicate that both class imbalance and labelling method affect
performance, and are factors that should be considered when designing automatic
sarcasm detection systems. We conclude that for progress to be made in
real-world sarcasm detection, we will require a new class labelling scheme that
is able to access the `common ground' held between conversational parties.
