Abstract#==#Works on Twitter community detection have yielded new ways to extract valuable
insights from social media. Through this technique, Twitter users can be
grouped into different types of communities such as those who have the same
interests, those who interact a lot, or those who have similar sentiments about
certain topics. Computationally, information is represented as a graph, and
community detection is the problem of partitioning the graph such that each
community is more densely connected to each other than to the rest of the
network. It has been shown that incorporating sentiment analysis can improve
community detection when looking for sentiment-based communities. However, such
works only perform sentiment analysis in isolation without considering the
tweet's various contextual information. Examples of these contextual
information are social network structure, and conversational, author, and topic
contexts. Disregarding these information poses a problem because at times,
context is needed to clearly infer the sentiment of a tweet. Thus, this
research aims to improve detection of sentiment-based communities on Twitter by
performing contextual sentiment analysis.
