Abstract#==#Text categorization is an important task in current natural language processing
pipelines. However, most works in this area are focused on Western languages
ignoring other Semitic languages like Arabic. These languages are of immense
political and social importance necessitating robust categorization techniques.
In this paper, we present a novel three-stage technique to efficiently classify
Arabic documents into different categories based on the words they contain. We
leverage the significance of root-words in Arabic and incorporate a combination
of Markov clustering and Deep Belief networks to classify Arabic words into
separate groups (clusters). Our approach is tested on two public datasets
giving a F-Measure of 91\%.
