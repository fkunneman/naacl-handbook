Abstract#==#Previous optimisations of parameters affecting the word-context association
measure used in distributional vector space models have focused either on
high-dimensional vectors with hundreds of thousands of dimensions, or dense
vectors with dimensionality of few hundreds; but dimensionality of few
thousands is often applied in compositional tasks as it is still
computationally feasible and does not require the dimensionality reduction
step. We present a systematic study of the interaction of the parameters of the
association measure and vector dimensionality, and derive parameter selection
heuristics that achieve performance across word similarity and relevance
datasets competitive with the results previously reported in the literature
achieved by highly dimensional or dense models.
