Abstract#==#A hierarchical word alignment model that searches for k-best partial alignments
on
target constituent 1-best parse trees has been shown to outperform previous
models. However, relying solely on 1-best parses trees might hinder the search
for good alignments because 1-best trees are not necessarily the best for word
alignment tasks in practice. This paper introduces a dependency forest based
word alignment model, which utilizes target dependency forests in an attempt to
minimize the impact on limitations attributable to 1-best parse trees. We
present how k-best alignments are constructed over target-side dependency
forests. Alignment experiments on the Japanese-English language pair show a
relative error reduction of 4% of the alignment score compared to a model with
1-best parse trees.
