Abstract#==#In addition to the sentiments expressed by
a speaker, opinions on the web also convey
suggestions. Such text comprise of advice,
recommendations and tips on a variety of
points of interest. We propose that suggestions
can be extracted from the available
opinionated text and put to several use
cases. The problem has been identified
only recently as a viable task, and there is
a lot of scope for research in the direction
of problem definition, datasets, and methods.
From an abstract view, standard algorithms
for tasks like sentence classification
and keyphrase extraction appear to be usable
for suggestion mining. However, initial
experiments reveal that there is a need
for new methods, or variations in the existing
ones for addressing the problem specific
challenges. We present a research
proposal which divides the problem into
three main research questions. We walk
through the research questions, presenting
our findings, results and future directions.
