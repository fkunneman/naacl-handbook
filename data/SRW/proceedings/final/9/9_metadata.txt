Abstract#==#We propose a new dataset for evaluating a Japanese lexical simplification
method. 
Previous datasets have several deficiencies. 
All of them substitute only a single target word, and some of them extract
sentences only from newswire corpus. 
In addition, most of these datasets do not allow ties and integrate
simplification ranking from all the annotators without considering the quality.

In contrast, our dataset has the following advantages: 
(1) It is the first controlled and balanced dataset for Japanese lexical
simplification with high correlation with human judgement and (2) the
consistency of the simplification ranking is improved by allowing candidates to
have ties and by considering the reliability of annotators.
