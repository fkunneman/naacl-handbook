Abstract#==#We propose a method for improving the dependency parsing of complex sentences.
This method assumes segmentation of input sentences into clauses and does not
require to re-train a parser of one's choice. We represent a sentence clause
structure using clause charts that provide a layer of embedding for each clause
in the sentence. Then we formulate a parsing strategy as a two-stage process
where (1) coordinated and subordinated clauses of the sentence are parsed
separately with respect to the sentence clause chart and (2) their dependency
trees become subtrees of the final tree of the sentence. The object language is
Czech and the parser used is a maximum spanning tree parser trained on the
Prague Dependency Treebank. We have achieved an average 0.97% improvement in
the unlabeled attachment score. Although the method has been designed for the
dependency parsing of Czech, it is useful for other parsing techniques and
languages.
