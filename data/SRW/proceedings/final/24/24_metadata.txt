Abstract#==#This paper evaluates the challenges in-
volved in shallow parsing of Dravidian
languages which are highly agglutinative
and morphologically rich. Text processing
tasks in these languages are not trivial be-
cause multiple words concatenate to form
a single string with morpho-phonemic
changes at the point of concatenation. This
phenomenon known as Sandhi, in turn
complicates the individual word identifi-
cation. Shallow parsing is the task of
identification of correlated group of words
given a raw sentence. The current work is
an attempt to study the effect of Sandhi in
building shallow parsers for Dravidian lan-
guages by evaluating its effect on Malay-
alam, one of the main languages from Dra-
vidian family. We provide an in-depth
analysis of effect of Sandhi in developing a
robust shallow parser pipeline with exper-
imental results emphasizing on how sen-
sitive the individual components of shal-
low parser are, towards the accuracy of a
sandhi splitter. Our work can serve as a
guiding light for building robust text pro-
cessing systems in Dravidian language.
