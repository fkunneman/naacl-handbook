Abstract#==#This paper presents an application of the meta-bootstrapping algorithm
from Riloff and Jones 1999 as a means to handle difficulties associated with
non-standard language usage in the social media domain when tweets were
analyzed for potentially containing adverse drug events. The paper details
the importance of adverse event detection, presents a large new dataset, and
steps through several different evaluations exploring the effects of
incrementing the amount of unannotated social media data given to the
bootstrapping
procedure. Modifications of the original algorithm are discussed in addition to
highlighting several important examples of how meta-bootstrapped lexicons can
handle internet language use within the clinical domain in a way studies
using medical ontologies cannot.
