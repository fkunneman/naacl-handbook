Abstract#==#In this research, we build a Wikification corpus for advancing Japanese Entity 
Linking. This corpus consists of 340 Japanese newspaper articles with 25,675
entity mentions. All entity mentions are labeled by a fine-grained semantic
classes (200 classes), and 19,121 mentions were successfully linked to Japanese
Wikipedia articles. Even with the fine-grained semantic classes, we found it
hard to define the target of entity linking annotations and to utilize the
fine-grained semantic classes to improve the accuracy of entity linking.
