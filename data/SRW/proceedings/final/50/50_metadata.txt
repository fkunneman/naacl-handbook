Abstract#==#This paper proposes a new unsupervised technique for clustering a collection of
documents written by distinct individuals into authorial components. We
highlight the importance of utilizing syntactic structure to cluster documents
by author, and demonstrate experimental results that show the method we outline
performs on par with state-of-the-art techniques. Additionally, we argue that
this feature set outperforms previous methods in cases where authors
consciously emulate each other's style or are otherwise rhetorically similar.
