Abstract#==#The rapidly growing biomedical literature has been a challenging target for
natural language processing algorithms. One of the tasks these algorithms focus
on is called named entity recognition (NER), often employed to tag gene
mentions. Here we describe a new approach for this task, an approach that uses
graph-based semi-supervised learning to train a Conditional Random Field (CRF)
model. Benchmarking it on the BioCreative II Gene Mention tagging task, we
achieved statistically significant improvements in F-measure over BANNER, a
widely used biomedical NER system. We note that our tool is transductive and
modular in nature, and can be integrated with other CRF-based supervised NER
tools.
