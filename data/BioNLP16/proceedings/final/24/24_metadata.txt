Abstract#==#Extracting bio-entity relations has emerged as an important task due to the
ever-growing number of bio-medical documents. In this paper, we present a
simple and novel representation for extracting bio-entity relationships. The
state-of-the-art systems for such tasks rely on word based representations and
variations of linguistic driven features. In contrast, we model bio-text by the
most basic character based string representation with a family of string
kernel. 
This eliminates time consuming parsing, issue of rare words and domain
specific pre-processing. This simple representation makes our approach fast and
flexible for any bio-NLP dataset. We demonstrate comparable performance and
faster computation time of our approach versus previous state-of-the-art kernel
methods.
