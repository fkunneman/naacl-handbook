Abstract#==#Gradable adjectives are inherently vague and are used by clinicians to document
medical interpretations (e.g., severe reaction, mild symptoms). We present a
comprehensive study of gradable adjectives used in the clinical domain. We
automatically identify gradable adjectives and demonstrate that they have a
substantial presence in clinical text. Further, we show that there is a
specific pattern associated with their usage, where certain medical
concepts are more likely to be described using these adjectives than others.
Interpretation of statements using such adjectives is a barrier in medical
decision making. Therefore, we use a simple probabilistic model to ground their
meaning based on their usage in context.
