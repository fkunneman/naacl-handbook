Abstract#==#Detecting phenotype descriptors in text and linking them to ontology concepts
is a challenging task. Current state-of-the art concept recognizers struggle
with several issues due the variety of human expressiveness. Here we present
initial results of creating a dictionary of lexical variants for the Human
Phenotype Ontology. This work is a smaller but important part of a larger
project with a goal to improve recall in phenotype concept recognizers.
