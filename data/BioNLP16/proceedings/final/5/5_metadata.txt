Abstract#==#Document classification is an important and common application in natural
language processing. Scaling classification approaches to many targets faces a
bottleneck in acquiring gold standard labels. In this work, we develop and
evaluate a method for using informed topic models to noisily label documents,
creating a noisy but usable set of labels for training discriminative
classifiers. We investigate multiple ways to train this noisy classifier, and
the best performing method uses Wikipedia-seeded topic models to approximately
label training instances without any supervision. We evaluate these methods on
the classification task as well as in an active learning setting, in which they
are shown to improve learning rates over traditional active learning.
