Abstract#==#We propose a machine learning approach
for semantic recognition and normalization of clinical term descriptions.
Clinical terms considered here are noisy descriptions in Spanish language
written by
health care professionals in our electronic
health record system. These description
terms contain clinical findings, family history, suspected disease, among other
categories of concepts. Descriptions are
usually very short texts presenting high
lexical variability containing synonymy,
acronyms, abbreviations and typographical errors. Mapping description terms to
normalized descriptions requires medical
expertise which makes it difficult to develop a rule-based knowledge
engineering approach. In order to build a training
dataset we use those descriptions that have
been previously matched by terminologists to the hospital thesaurus database.
We generate a set of feature vectors based
on pairs of descriptions involving their individual and joint characteristics.
We propose an unsupervised learning approach to
discover term equivalence classes including synonyms, abbreviations, acronyms
and frequent typographical errors. We
evaluate different combinations of features
to train MaxEnt and XGBoost models.
Our system achieves an F 1 score of 89%
on the Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires
(HIBA) problem list.
