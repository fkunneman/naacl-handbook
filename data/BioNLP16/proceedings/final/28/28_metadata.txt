Abstract#==#In recent years extracting relevant information from biomedical and clinical
texts such as research articles, discharge summaries, or electronic health
records have been a subject of many research efforts and shared challenges.
Relation extraction is the process of detecting and classifying the semantic
relation among entities in a given piece of texts. Existing models for this
task in biomedical domain use either manually engineered features or kernel
methods to create feature vector. These features are then fed to classifier for
the prediction of the correct class. It turns out that the results of these
methods are highly dependent on quality of user designed features and also
suffer from curse of dimensionality. In this work we focus on extracting
relations from clinical discharge summaries. Our main objective is to exploit
the power of convolution neural network (CNN) to learn features automatically
and thus reduce the dependency on manual feature engineering. We evaluate
performance of the proposed model on i2b2-2010 clinical relation extraction
challenge dataset. Our results indicate that convolution neural network can be
a good model for relation exaction in clinical text without being dependent on
expert's knowledge on defining quality features.
