Abstract#==#Extracting information from mental health records can be useful for large-scale
clinical studies (e.g., to predict medication adherence or to understand
medication effects) in this clinical specialty largely underserved by the
Natural Language Processing (NLP) community. Vocabularies that contain medical
terms for specific clinical use-cases, such as signs, symptoms, histories,
social risk factors, are valuable resources for the development of NLP systems
that aid clinicians in extracting information from text. Substance abuse is an
important variable for many clinical use-cases, but, to our knowledge, there
are no publicly available vocabularies that cover these types of terms. In this
study, we apply and combine three methods for generating vocabularies related
to substance abuse. We propose a simple and systematic method to generate
highly relevant vocabularies and evaluate these vocabularies with respect to
size and content, as well as coverage and relevance when applied to authentic
psychiatric notes.
