Abstract#==#The quality of word embeddings depends on the input corpora, model
architectures, and hyper-parameter settings. Using the state-of-the-art neural
embedding tool \textit{word2vec} and
both intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations, we present a comprehensive study of
how the performance of embeddings changes according to these features. Apart
from identifying the most influential hyper-parameters, we also discover one
that creates contradictory results between intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations.
Furthermore, we find that bigger corpora do not necessarily produce better
biomedical domain word embeddings.
We make our evaluation tools and resources as well as the created
state-of-the-art word embeddings available under open licenses from [redacted
for blind review].
