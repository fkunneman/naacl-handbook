Abstract#==#Time-sensitive communication of critical imaging findings like pneumothorax or
pulmonary embolism to referring physicians is important for patient safety.
However, radiology findings are recorded in free-text format, relying on verbal
communication that is not always successful. Natural language processing can
provide automated suggestions to radiologists that new critical findings be
added to a followup list. We present a pilot assessment of the feasibility of
an automated critical
finding suggestion system for radiology reporting by assessing suggestions made
by the pyConTextNLP algorithm. Our evaluation focused on the false alarm rate
to determine feasibility of deployment without increasing alert fatigue.
pyConTextNLP identified 77 critical findings from 1,370 chest exams. Review of
the suggested findings demonstrated a 7.8% false alarm rate. We discuss the
errors, which would be challenging to address, and compare pyConTextNLPâ€™s
false alarm rate to false alarm rates of similar systems from the literature.
