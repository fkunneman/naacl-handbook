Abstract#==#This paper evaluates the difference between human pathway curation and current
NLP systems. We propose graph analysis methods for quantifying              the gap
between
human curated pathway maps and the output of state-of-the-art automatic NLP
systems. Evaluation is performed on the popular mTOR pathway. Based on
analyzing where current systems perform well and where they fail, we identify
possible avenues for progress.
