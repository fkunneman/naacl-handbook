Abstract#==#Identification of the certainty of events is an important text mining problem.
In particular, biomedical texts report medical conditions or findings that
might be factual, hedged or negated. Identification of negation and its scope
over a term of interest determines whether a finding is reported and is a
challenging task. Not much work has been performed for Spanish in this domain. 

In this work we introduce different algorithms developed to determine if a term
of interest is under the scope of negation in radiology reports written in
Spanish. The methods include syntactic techniques based in rules derived from
PoS tagging patterns,             constituent tree patterns and dependency tree
patterns,
and an adaption of NegEx, a well known rule-based negation detection algorithm
\cite{Chapman2001}. All methods outperform a simple dictionary lookup algorithm
 developed as baseline. NegEx and the PoS tagging pattern method obtain the
best results with 0.92 F1.
