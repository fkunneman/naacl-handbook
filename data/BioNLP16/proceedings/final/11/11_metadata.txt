Abstract#==#Biomedical relations are often expressed between entities occurring within the
same sentence through syntactic means. However, a significant portion of such
relations (in particular, causal relations) are expressed implicitly across
sentence boundaries. Inferring these discourse-level relations can be
challenging in the absence of syntactic clues. In this paper, we present a
study of textual characteristics that contribute to expression of implicit
causal relations across sentence boundaries. Focusing on a chemical-disease
relationship corpus, we identify and investigate the contribution of various
features that can assist in identifying such inter-sentential relations. Using
these features for supervised learning, we were able to improve previously
reported best results by more than 13%. Our results demonstrate the usefulness
of the proposed features and the importance of using a balanced dataset for
this task.
