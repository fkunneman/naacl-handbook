Abstract#==#Detecting healthcare-associated infections pose a major challenge in
healthcare. Using natural language processing and machine learning applied on
electronic patient records is one approach that has been shown to work. However
the results indicate that there was room for improvement and therefore we have
applied deep learning methods. Specifically we implemented a network of stacked
sparse auto encoders and a network of stacked restricted Boltzmann machines.
Our best results were obtained using the stacked restricted Boltzmann machines
with a precision of 0.79 and a recall of 0.88.
