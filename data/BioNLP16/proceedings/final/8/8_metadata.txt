Abstract#==#Temporal relation extraction is important for understanding ordering of events
from
a narrative text. In this work we describe a method for increasing the number
of
high-quality training instances available to a temporal relation extraction
task, with
an adaptation to different annotation styles in the clinical domain by taking
advantage
of the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). This method notably improves
clinical temporal relation extraction, works beyond featurizing or duplicating
the
same information, can generalize between argument signals in a more effective
and
robust fashion. We also report a new state-of-the-art result, which is a two
point improvement
over the best Clinical TempEval 2016 system.
