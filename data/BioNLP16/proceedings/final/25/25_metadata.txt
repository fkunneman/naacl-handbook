Abstract#==#We consider the use of distant supervision for biological information
extraction (BioIE), and introduce two understudied corpora of this form, the
Biological Expression Language (BEL) Large Corpus and the Pathway Logic (PL)
Datum Corpus.  Each resource eschews annotation at the sentence constituent
level, and the PL corpus requires synthesis of information across multiple
sentences to construct composite knowledge frames.  Decomposing this problem
into feature induction for slot-level attributes, followed by event assembly
over this space of features, we introduce a novel, general-purpose pattern
induction procedure, evaluating it against these two corpora, demonstrating its
ability to induce effective detection against dependency parses.
