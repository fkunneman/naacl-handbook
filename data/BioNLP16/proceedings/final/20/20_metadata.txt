Abstract#==#Word embeddings have been successfully exploited in systems for NLP tasks, such
as parsing and text classification. It is intuitive that word embeddings
created from a larger corpus would provide a better coverage of vocabulary.
Meanwhile, word embeddings trained on a corpus related to the given task or
target domain would more effectively represent the semantics of terms. However,
in some emerging domains (e.g. bio-surveillance using social media data), it
may be difficult to find a domain corpus that is large enough for creating
effective word embeddings. To deal with this problem, we propose novel
approaches that use both word embeddings created from generic and target domain
corpora. Our experimental results on sentence classification tasks show that
our approaches significantly improve the performance of an existing
convolutional neural network that achieved state-of-the-art performances on
several text classification tasks.
