Abstract#==#For many types of high-dimensional data, such as natural language corpora, the
vast majority of extracted variables or features are essentially noise. Culling
such features can not only reveal important patterns, but also improve the
performance of supervised and unsupervised machine algorithms.                       
 
Most
research
on feature selection has focused on the statistical measures used to rank
features.  Meanwhile, little work has been done developing techniques for
identifying the optimal subset of features without repeatedly training models. 
However, developing such techniques is important, as they can significantly
decrease computation time while providing a way to determine the features that
characterize the classes within a data set, independent of how the data may be
classified in the future.  Here we introduce a novel method based on
information foraging that works in conjunction with existing feature ranking
methods to automatically determine a subset of important features.  The method
is demonstrated on simulated and linguistic data from psychiatric interviews. 
We show that the method is able to accurately determine the features that
characterize the classes within both data sets.  The method is fast, simple,
and independent of any method of classifying the data, and can be extended to
any high-dimensional data set.
