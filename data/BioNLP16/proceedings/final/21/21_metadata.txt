Abstract#==#Entity disambiguation in the biomedical domain is an essential task in any text
mining pipeline. Much existing work share one limitation, in that their model
training prerequisite and/or runtime computation are too expensive to be
applied to all ambiguous entities in real-time. We propose an automatic,
light-weight method that processes MEDLINE abstracts at large-scale and with
high-quality output. Our method exploits MeSH terms and knowledge in UMLS to
first identify unambiguous anchor entities, and then disambiguate remaining
entities via heuristics. Experiments showed that our method is 79.6% and 87.7%
accurate under strict and relaxed rating schemes, respectively. When compared
to MetaMap's disambiguation, our method is one order of magnitude faster with a
slight advantage in accuracy.
