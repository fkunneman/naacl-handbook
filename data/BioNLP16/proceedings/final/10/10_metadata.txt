Abstract#==#In this paper, we report a knowledge-based method for Word Sense Disambiguation
in the domains of biomedical and clinical text. We combine word representations
created on large corpora with a small number of definitions from the UMLS to
create concept representations, which we then compare to representations of the
context of ambiguous terms. Using no relational information, we obtain
comparable performance to previous approaches on the MSH-WSD dataset, which is
a well-known dataset in the biomedical domain. Additionally, our method is fast
and easy to set up and extend to other domains. Supplementary materials,
