Abstract#==#Most existing corpus-based approaches to semantic representation suffer from
inaccurate modeling of domain-specific lexical items which either have low
frequencies or are non-existent in open-domain corpora. We put forward a
technique that improves word embeddings in specific domains by first
transforming a given lexical item to a sorted list of representative words and
then modeling the item by combining the embeddings of these words. Our
experiments show that the proposed technique can significantly improve some of
the recent word embedding techniques while modeling a set of lexical items in
the biomedical domain, i.e., phenotypes.
