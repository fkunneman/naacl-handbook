Abstract#==#Linguistic annotation is the backbone behind any successful approach in Natural
Language Processing (NLP), because annotated corpora are necessary to train and
evaluate natural language processing applications. Thus, a lot of effort is put
into obtaining high-agreement annotated datasets. Recent research has shown
that 
annotator disagreement carries actual signal for regularizing NLP models. 
However, prior work focused on part of speech tagging and on a single language.
We take this further by examining a semantic task (supersense tagging) and the
cross-language scenario. In particular, we examine how reliable disagreement is
for sense annotation and we gauge in a preliminary study whether disagreements
transfer across languages.
