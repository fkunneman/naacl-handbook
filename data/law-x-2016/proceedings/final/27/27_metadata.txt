Abstract#==#Automatically detecting the stance of people toward political and ideological
topics --namely their "Ideological Perspective"-- from social media is a
rapidly growing research area with a wide range of applications. Research in
such a field faces several challenges among which is the lack of annotated
corpora and associated guidelines for collecting annotations. The problem is
even more pronounced in situations where there is no clear taxonomy for the
common community perspectives and ideologies. The challenges are exacerbated
when the communities where we need to gather these annotations are in a state
of turmoil causing subjectivity and intimidation to be factors in the
annotation process. Accordingly, we present the process for creating a robust
and succinct set of guidelines for annotating "Egyptian Ideological
Perspectives". We collect social media data discussing Egyptian politics and
develop an iterative feedback  annotation framework refining the annotation
task and associated guidelines attempting to circumvent both weaknesses. Our
efforts lead to a significant increase in inter-annotator agreement measures
from 75.7% to 92% overall agreement.
