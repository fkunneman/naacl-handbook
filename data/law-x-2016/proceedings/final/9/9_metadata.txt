Abstract#==#English grammars indicate a variety of relations holding between conjoined VPs.
For example, VPs conjoined by "and" evince such senses as Result, Temporal
Sequence, and Concession. Although all these senses are ones associated with
discourse relations, conjoined VPs have not been fully included in discourse
annotation. Because of the value of discourse-annotated corpora for developing
approaches to automated sense recognition, we have added their annotation to
the Penn Discourse TreeBank. This paper describes how tokens were identified;
how the process of span and sense annotation was modified and extended in order
to keep the annotation of intra-sentential multi-clausal structures consistent
with the rest of the corpus; and what the resulting corpus looks like, in terms
of token frequency and common sense patterns.
