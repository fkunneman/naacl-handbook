Abstract#==#We present a method that, for the first time in a broad coverage
setting, uses natural language generation to automatically construct
disambiguating paraphrases for structurally ambiguous sentences.  By
simply asking naive annotators to clarify which paraphrase is closer
in meaning to the original sentence, the resulting paraphrases can
potentially enable meaning judgments for parser training and domain
adaptation to be crowd-sourced on a massive scale.  To validate the
method, we demonstrate that meaning judgments crowd-sourced in this
way via Amazon Mechanical Turk have reasonably high accuracy---e.g.
80%, given a strong majority choice between two paraphrases---with
accuracy increasing as the level of agreement among annotators
increases.  We also show that even with just the limited validation
data gathered to date, the crowd-sourced judgments make it possible
to retrain a parser to achieve significantly higher accuracy in a
novel domain.  We conclude with lessons learned for gathering such
judgments on a much larger scale.
