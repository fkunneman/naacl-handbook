Abstract#==#We compared two methods to annotate a corpus via non-expert annotators for
named entity (NE) recognition task, which are 
(1) revising the results of the existing NE recognizer and (2) annotating NEs
only by hand.  
We investigated the annotation time, the degrees of agreement, and the
performances based on the gold standard. 
As we have two annotators for one file of each method, we evaluated the two
performances, which are 
the averaged performances over the two annotators and the performances deeming
the annotations correct when either of them is correct.  
The experiments revealed that the semi-automatic annotation was faster and
showed higher agreements and performances on average.  
However they also indicated that sometimes fully manual annotation should be
used for some texts whose genres are far from its training data.  
In addition, the experiments using the annotated corpora via semi-automatic and
fully manual annotation indicated that 
the F-measures sometimes could be better for some texts when we used manual
annotation than when we used semi-automatic annotation.
