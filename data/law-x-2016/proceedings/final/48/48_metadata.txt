Abstract#==#This paper describes the process of annotating a historical US civil war corpus
with geographic reference. Reference annotations are given at two different
textual scales: individual place names and documents. This is the first
published corpus of its kind in document-level geolocation, and it has over
10,000 disambiguated toponyms, double the amount of any prior toponym corpus.
We outline many challenges and considerations in creating such a corpus, and we
evaluate baseline and benchmark toponym resolution and document geolocation
systems on it. Aspects of the corpus suggest several recommendations for proper
annotation procedure for the tasks.
