Abstract#==#We propose a new task of extracting event-event relations across documents. We
present our efforts at designing an annotation schema and building a corpus for
this task. Our schema includes five main types of relations: Inheritance,
Expansion, Contingency, Comparison and Temporality, along with 21 subtypes. We
also lay out the main challenges based on detailed inter-annotator disagreement
and error analysis. We hope these resources can serve as a benchmark to
encourage research on this new problem.
