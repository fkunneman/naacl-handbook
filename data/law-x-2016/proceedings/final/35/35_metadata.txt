Abstract#==#We explore the annotation of information structure in German and
  compare the quality of expert annotation with crowd-sourced
  annotation taking into account the cost of reaching crowd
  consensus. 

  Concretely, we discuss a crowd-sourcing effort annotating
  focus in a task-based corpus of German containing reading
  comprehension questions and answers. Against the backdrop of a gold
  standard reference resulting from adjudicated expert annotation, we
  evaluate a crowd sourcing experiment using majority voting to
  determine a baseline performance. To refine the crowd-sourcing
  setup, we introduce the Consensus Cost as a measure of agreement
  within the crowd. We investigate the usefulness of Consensus Cost as
  a measure of crowd annotation quality both intrinsically, in
  relation to the expert gold standard, and extrinsically, by
  integrating focus annotation information into a system performing
  Short Answer Assessment taking into account the Consensus Cost.

  We find that low Consensus Cost in crowd sourcing indicates high
  quality, though high cost does not necessarily indicate low accuracy
  but increased variability. Overall, taking Consensus Cost into
  account improves both intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation measures.
