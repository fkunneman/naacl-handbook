Abstract#==#We present a new multi-layered annotation scheme for orthographic errors in
freely written German texts produced by primary school children. The scheme is
closely linked to the German graphematic system and defines categories for both
general structural word properties and error-related properties. Furthermore,
it features multiple layers of information which can be used to evaluate an
error. The categories can also be used to investigate properties of
correctly-spelled words, and to compare them to the erroneous spellings. For
representing the data, we propose LearnerXML, an XML-format, which we import in
EXMARaLDA for manual annotation.
