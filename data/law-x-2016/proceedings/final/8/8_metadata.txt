Abstract#==#This paper presents the conversion of SynTagRus dependency structures (DS) into
English Penn Treebank style phrase structures (PS), whose resulting data will
be used to train a statistical PS parser for Russian and create a large-scale
PS-parsed corpus. The implemented DS-to-PS conversion includes various
innovative features in order to create PS trees that are closest to Penn
Treebank style while optimally preserving information present in the original
DS annotations. We believe that the newly converted PS treebank will be not
only an adequate training dataset for our ongoing project but also a valuable
resource for traditional and computational linguistic research.
