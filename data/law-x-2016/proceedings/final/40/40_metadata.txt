Abstract#==#Universal Dependencies (UD) are gaining much attention of late, for systematic
evaluation of cross-lingual techniques for cross-lingual dependency parsing. In
this paper we present our work in line with UD. Our contribution to this, is
manifold.
 We extend UD to Indian languages through translation of Paninian Dependencies
to UD for Hindi Dependency Treebank (HDTB). We discuss the differences in
annotation in both the schemes, present parsing experiments for both the
formalisms and empirically evaluate their weaknesses and strengths for Hindi.
We produce an automatically converted Hindi Treebank conforming to the
international standard UD scheme, making it useful as a resource for
multilingual language technology.
