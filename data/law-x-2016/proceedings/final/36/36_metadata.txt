Abstract#==#In this paper we describe our efforts on POS annotation of a code-switching
corpus created from Turkish-German tweets. We use Universal Dependencies (UD)
POS tags as our tag set. While the German parts of the corpus employ UD
specifications, for the Turkish parts we propose annotation guidelines that
adopt UD's language-general rules when it is applicable and adapt its
principles to Turkish-specific phenomena when it is not. The resulting corpus
has POS annotation of 1029 tweets, which is aligned with existing language
identification annotation.
