Abstract#==#The semantic relationship between a sentence and its context may be marked
explicitly, or left to inference. Rohde et al. (2015) showed that, contrary to
common assumptions, this isn't "exclusive or": a conjunction can often be
inferred alongside an explicit discourse adverbial. Here we broaden the
investigation to a larger set of 20 discourse adverbials by eliciting ~28K
conjunction completions via crowdsourcing. Our data replicate and extend
earlier findings that discourse adverbials do indeed license inferred
conjunctions. Further, the diverse patterns observed for the adverbials include
cases in which more than one valid connection can be inferred, each one
endorsed by a substantial number of participants; such differences in
annotation might otherwise be written off as annotator error or bias, or just a
low level of inter-annotator agreement. These results will inform future
discourse annotation endeavors by revealing where it is necessary to entertain
implicit relations and elicit several judgments to fully characterize
discourse relationships.
