Abstract#==#Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) is an annotation framework in which the
meaning of a full sentence is represented as a rooted, acyclic, directed graph.
In this paper, we describe a  project in which we develop specifications
for the annotation of a Chinese AMR corpus: the Chinese translation of the
Little Prince. The inter-agreement smatch score between the two annotators is
0.83. We also propose to integrate alignment into Chinese AMR annotation.
