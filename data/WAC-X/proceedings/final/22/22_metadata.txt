Abstract#==#This paper describes the goals, design and results of a shared task on the
automatic linguistic annotation of German language data from genres of
computer-mediated communication (CMC), social media interactions and Web
corpora. The two subtasks of tokenization and part-of-speech tagging were
performed on two data sets: (i) a genuine CMC data set with samples from
several CMC genres, and (ii) a Web corpora data set of CC-licensed Web pages
which represents the data found in large corpora crawled from the Web. The
teams participating in shared task achieved a substantial improvement over
current off-the-shelf tools for German. The best tokenizer reached an F-score
of 99.57% (vs. 98.95% off-the-shelf baseline), while the best tagger reached an
accuracy of 90.44% (vs. 84.86% baseline). The gold standard (more than 20,000
tokens of training and test data) is freely available online together with
detailed annotation guidelines.
