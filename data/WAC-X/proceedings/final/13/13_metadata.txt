Abstract#==#In this paper we report our analysis of the similarities between webpages that
are crawled from European academic websites, and comparison of their
distribution in terms of the English language variety (native English vs
English as a lingua franca) and their language family (based on the country's
official language).  After building a corpus of university webpages, we
selected a set of relevant descriptors that can represent their text types
using the framework of the Functional Text Dimensions. Manual annotation of a
random sample of academic pages provides the basis for classifying the
remaining texts on each dimension.  Reliable thresholds are then determined in
order to evaluate precision and assess the distribution of text types by each
dimension, with the ultimate goal of analysing language features over English
varieties and language families.
