Abstract#==#This paper employs both a web-as-corpus and a Twitter-as-corpus approach to
present a longitudinal case study of the establishment of three recently
coined, synonymous neologisms: 'rapefugee', 'rapeugee' and 'rapugee'. We
describe the retrieval and processing of the web and Twitter data and discuss
the dynamics of the competition between the three forms within and across both
datasets based on quantitative summaries of the results. The results show that
various language-external events boost the usage of the terms both on the web
and on Twitter, with the latter typically ahead of the former by some days.
Beside absolute frequencies, we distinguish between several special usages of
the target words and their effects on the establishment process. For the web
corpus, we examine target words appearing in the title of websites and
metalinguistic usages; for the Twitter corpus, we examine hashtag uses and
retweets. We find that the use of hashtags and retweets significantly affects
the spread of the neologisms both on Twitter and on the web.
