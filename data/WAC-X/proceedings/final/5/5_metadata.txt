Abstract#==#We present a detailed description of our submission to the EmpiriST shared task
2015 for tokenization and part-of-speech tagging of German social media text.
As relatively little training data is provided, neither tokenization nor PoS
tagging can be learned from the data alone. For tokenization, our system uses
regular expressions for general cases and word lists for exceptions. For PoS
tagging, adding unsupervised knowledge beyond the available training data is
the most important factor for reaching acceptable tagging accuracy. A learning
curve experiment shows furthermore that more in-domain training data is very
likely to further increase accuracy.
