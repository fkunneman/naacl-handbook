Abstract#==#Emojis are a quickly spreading and rather unknown communication phenomenon
which occasionally receives attention in the mainstream press, but lacks the
scientific exploration it deserves. This paper is a first attempt at
investigating the global distribution of emojis. We perform our analysis of the
spatial distribution of emojis on a dataset of ~17 million (and growing)
geo-encoded tweets containing emojis by running a cluster analysis over
countries represented as emoji distributions and performing correlation
analysis of emoji distributions and World Development Indicators. We show that
emoji usage tends to draw quite a realistic picture of the living conditions in
various parts of our world.
