Abstract#==#In this paper, I present a specialized open-source crawler that can be used to
obtain bias-reduced samples from the web. First, I briefly discuss the
relevance of bias-reduced web corpus sampling for corpus linguistics. Then, I
summarize theoretical results that show how commonly used crawling methods
obtain highly biased samples from the web. The theoretical part of the paper is
followed by a description my feature-complete and stable ClaraX crawler which
performs so-called Random Walks, a form of crawling that allows for
bias-reduced sampling if combined with methods of post-crawl rejection
sampling. Finally, results from two large crawling experiments in the German
web are reported. I show that bias reduction is feasible if certain technical
and practical hurdles are overcome.
