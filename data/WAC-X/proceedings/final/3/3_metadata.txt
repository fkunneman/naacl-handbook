Abstract#==#We describe a system to collect web data for Low Resource Languages, to augment
language model training data for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and keyword
search by reducing the Out-of-Vocabulary (OOV) rates -- words in the test set
that did not appear in the training set for ASR.   We test this system on seven
Low Resource Languages from the IARPA Babel Program:  Paraguayan Guarani, Igbo,
Amharic, Halh Mongolian, Javanese, Pashto, and Dholuo.              The success of
our
system compared with other web collection systems is due to the targeted
collection sources (blogs, twitter, forums) and the  inclusion of a separate
language identification component in its pipeline, which filters the data
initially collected before finally saving it.  Our results show a major
reduction of OOV rates relative to those calculated from training corpora alone
and major reductions in OOV rates calculated in terms of keywords in the
training development set.  We also describe differences among genres in this
reduction, which vary by language but show a pronounced influence for
augmentation from Twitter data for most languages.
