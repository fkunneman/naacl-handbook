Abstract#==#Many studies have found that language alterations can aid in the detection of
certain medical afflictions. In this work, we present an ongoing project for
recollecting multilingual conversations with the elderly in Latin America. This
project, so far, involves the combined efforts of psychogeriatricians,
linguists, computer scientists, research nurses and geriatric caregivers from
six institutions across USA, Canada, Mexico and Ecuador. The recollections are
being made available to the international research community. They consist of
conversations with adults aged sixty and over, with different nationalities and
socio-economic backgrounds. Conversations are recorded on video, transcribed
and time-aligned. Additionally, we are in the process of receiving written
texts—recent or old—authored by the participants, provided voluntarily.
Each participant is recorded at least twice a year to allow longitudinal
studies. Furthermore, information such as medical history, educational
background, economic level, occupation, medications and treatments is being
registered to aid conducting research on treatment progress and pharmacological
effects. Potential studies derived from this work include speech, voice,
writing, discourse, and facial and corporal expression analysis. We believe
that our recollections incorporate complementary data that can aid researchers
in further understanding the progression of cognitive degenerative diseases of
the elderly.
