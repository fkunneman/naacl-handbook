Abstract#==#This paper aims at utilizing cognitive information obtained from the eye
movements behavior of annotators for automatic co-reference resolution. We
first record eye-movement behavior of 14 participants resolving co-references
in 22 documents selected from a standard dataset. By inspecting the
gaze-regression profiles of our participants, we observe how regressive
saccades account for selection of potential antecedents. Based on this
observation, we then propose heuristics to utilize gaze data to prune
mention-pairs in  mention-pair model, a popular paradigm for automatic
co-reference resolution. Significant improvement in accuracy across several
classifiers is observed with our heuristics, demonstrating why cognitive data
can be useful for a difficult task like co-reference resolution.
