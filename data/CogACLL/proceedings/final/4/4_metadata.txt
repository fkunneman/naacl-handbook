Abstract#==#One of the characteristics of child-directed speech is its high degree of
repetitiousness. Sequences of repetitious utterances with a constant intention,
variation sets, have been shown to be correlated with children’s language
acquisition. To obtain a baseline for the occurrences of variation sets in
Swedish, we annotate 18 parent--child dyads using a generalised definition
according to which the varying form may pertain not just to the wording but
also to prosody and/or non-verbal cues. To facilitate further empirical
investigation, we introduce a surface algorithm for automatic extraction of
variation sets which is easily replicable and language-independent. We evaluate
the algorithm on the Swedish gold standard, and use it for extracting variation
sets in Croatian, English and Russian. We show that the proportion of variation
sets in child-directed speech decreases consistently as a function of
children's age across Swedish, Croatian, English and Russian.
