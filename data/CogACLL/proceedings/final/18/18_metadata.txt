Abstract#==#Syntactic bootstrapping is the hypothesis that learners can use the preliminary
syntactic structure of a sentence to identify and characterise the meanings of
novel verbs. Previous work has shown that syntactic bootstrapping can begin
using only a few seed nouns (Connor et al., 2010; Connor et al., 2012). Here,
we relax their key assumption: rather than training the model over the entire
corpus at once (batch mode), we train the model incrementally, thus more
realistically simulating a human learner. We also improve on the verb
prediction method by incorporating the assumption that verb assignments are
stable over time. We show that, given a high enough number of seed nouns
(around 30), an incremental model achieves similar performance to the batch
model. We also find that the number of seed nouns shown to be sufficient in the
previous work is not sufficient under the more realistic incremental model. The
results demonstrate that adopting more realistic assumptions about the early
stages of language acquisition can provide new insights without undermining
performance.
