Abstract#==#How do infants learn the meanings of their first words? This study investigates
the informativeness and temporal dynamics of non-verbal cues that signal the
speaker's referent in a model of early word--referent mapping. To measure the
information provided by such cues, a supervised classifier is trained on
information extracted from a multimodally annotated corpus of 18 videos of
parent--child interaction with three children aged 7 to 33 months.
Contradicting previous research, we find that gaze is the single most
informative cue, and we show that this finding can be attributed to our
fine-grained temporal annotation. We also find that offsetting the timing of
the non-verbal cues reduces accuracy, especially if the offset is negative.
This is in line with previous research, and suggests that synchrony between
verbal and non-verbal cues is important if they are to be perceived as causally
related.
