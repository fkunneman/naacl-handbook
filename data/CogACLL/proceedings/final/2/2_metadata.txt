Abstract#==#We present a study about automated discourse analysis of oral narrative
language in adolescents with autistic spectrum disorder (ASD). The basis of
this evaluation is an existing dataset of fictional narrations of individuals
with ASD and two matched comparison groups. We use three robust measures for
quantifying different aspects of text cohesion on this corpus. These measures
and several combinations of them correlate strongly with human cohesion
annotations. Our evaluation will show which of these also distinguish the ASD
group from the two comparison  groups, which do not, and which differences are
related to language competence rather than to factors specific to ASD.
