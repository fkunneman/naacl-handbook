Abstract#==#This paper presents a method for linking models for aligning linguistic
etymological data with models for phylogenetic inference from population
genetics. We begin with a large database of genetically related words—sets of
cognates—from languages in a language family. We process the cognate sets to
obtain a complete alignment of the data. We use the alignments as input to a
model developed for phylogenetic reconstruction in population genetics. This is
achieved via a natural novel projection of the linguistic data onto genetic
primitives. As a result, we induce phylogenies based on aligned linguistic
data. We place the method in the context of those reported in the literature,
and illustrate its operation on data from the Uralic language family, which
results in family trees that are very close to the “true” (expected)
phylogenies.
