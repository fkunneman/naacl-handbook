Abstract#==#In this study, we model the causal links between the complexities of different
macroscopic aspects of child language. We consider pairs of sequences of
measurements of the quantity and diversity of the lexical and grammatical
properties. Each pair of sequences is taken as the trajectory of a
high-dimensional dynamical system, some of whose dimensions are unknown. We use
Multispatial Convergent Cross Mapping to ascertain the directions of causality
between the pairs of sequences. Our results provide support for the hypothesis
that  children learn grammar through distributional learning, where the
generalization of smaller structures enables generalizations at higher levels,
consistent with the proposals of construction-based approaches to language.
