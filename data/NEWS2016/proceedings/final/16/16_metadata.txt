Abstract#==#This report presents the results from the Ma-chine Transliteration Shared Task
conducted as part of The Sixth Named Entities Workshop (NEWS 2016) held at ACL
2016in Berlin, Germany. Similar to previous editions of NEWS Workshop, the
Shared Task featured machine transliteration of proper names over 14 different
language pairs, including 12 dif-ferent languages and two different Japanese
scripts.A total of 5 teams participated in the evaluation, submitting 255
standard and 19 non-standard runs, involving a diverse variety of
transliteration methodologies. Four perfor-mance metrics were used to report
the evalua-tion results. Once again, the NEWS shared task on machine
transliteration has successful-ly achieved its objectives by providing a common
ground for the research community to conduct comparative evaluations of
state-of-the-art technologies that will benefit the future research and
development in this area.
