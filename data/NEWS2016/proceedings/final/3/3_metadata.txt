Abstract#==#Transliteration is the phonetic translation between two different languages.
There are many works that approach transliteration using machine translation
methods. This paper describes the official baseline system for the NEWS 2016
workshop shared task. This baseline is based on a standard phrase-based machine
translation system using Moses. Results are between the range of best and worst
from last year’s workshops providing a nice starting point for participants
this year.
