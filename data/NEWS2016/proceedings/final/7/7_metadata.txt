Abstract#==#In this paper, we discuss our endeavors for the Named Entities Workshop (NEWS)
2016 transliteration shared task, where we focus on English to Thai
transliteration. The alignment between Thai orthography and phonology is not
always monotonous, but few transliteration systems take this into account. In
our proposed system, we exploit phonological knowledge to resolve problematic
instances where the monotonous alignment assumption breaks down. We achieve a
29% relative improvement over the baseline system for the NEWS 2016
transliteration shared task.
