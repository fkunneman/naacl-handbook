Abstract#==#Name entity recognition (NER) is an important subtask in natural language
processing. Various NER systems have been developed in the last decade. They
may target for different domains, employ different methodologies, work on
different languages, detect different types of entities, and support different
inputs and output formats. These conditions make it difficult for a user to
select the right NER tools for a specific task. Motivated by the need of NER
tools in our research work, we select several publicly available and
well-established NER tools to validate their outputs against both Wikipedia
gold standard corpus and a small set of manually annotated documents. All the
evaluations show consistent results on the selected tools. Finally, we
constructed a hybrid NER tool by combining the best performing tools for the
domains of our interest.
