Abstract#==#Typed lexicons that encode knowledge about the semantic types of an entity
name, e.g., that ‘Paris’ denotes a geolocation, product, or person, have
proven useful for many text processing tasks. While lexicons may be derived
from large-scale knowledge bases (KBs), KBs are inherently imperfect, in
particular they lack coverage with respect to long tail entity names. We infer
the types of a given entity name using multi-source learning, considering
information obtained by alignment to the Freebase knowledge base, Web-scale
distributional patterns, and global semi-structured contexts retrieved by means
of Web search. Evaluation in the challenging domain of social media shows that
multi-source learning improves performance compared with rule-based KB lookups,
boosting typing results for some semantic categories.
