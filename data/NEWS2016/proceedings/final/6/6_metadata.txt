Abstract#==#This paper presents a rule-based approach to Named Entity Recognition for the
German language. The approach rests upon deep linguistic parsing and has
already been applied to English and Russian. In this paper we present the first
results of our system, ABBYY InfoExtractor, on GermEval 2014 Shared Task
corpus. We focus on the main challenges of German NER that we have encountered
when adapting our system to German and possible solutions for them.
