Abstract#==#Transliteration is defined as phonetic
translation of names across languages.
Transliteration of Named Entities (NEs)
is necessary in many applications, such
as machine translation, corpus alignment,
cross-language IR, information extraction
and automatic lexicon acquisition. All
such systems call for high-performance
transliteration, which is the focus of
shared task in the NEWS 2016 workshop.
The objective of the shared task is to promote
machine transliteration research by
providing a common benchmarking platform
for the community to evaluate the
state-of-the-art technologies.
