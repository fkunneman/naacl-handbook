Abstract#==#Traditional name transliteration methods largely ignore source context
information and inter-dependency among entities for entity disambiguation. We
propose a novel approach to leverage state-of-the-art Entity Linking (EL)
techniques to automatically correct name transliteration results, using
collective inference from source contexts and additional evidence from
knowledge base. Experiments on transliterating names from seven languages to
English demonstrate that our approach achieves 2.6% to 15.7% absolute gain over
the baseline model, and significantly advances state-of-the-art. When
contextual information exists, our approach can achieve further gains (24.2%)
by collectively transliterating and disambiguating multiple related entities.
We also prove that combining Entity Linking and projecting resources from
related languages obtained comparable performance as the method using the same
amount of training pairs in the original languages without Entity Linking. The
transliteration systems are publicly available for research purpose at
