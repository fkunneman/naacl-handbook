Abstract#==#Our purely neural network-based system represents a paradigm shift away
from the techniques based on phrase-based statistical machine
translation we have used in the past. The approach exploits the 
agreement between a pair of target-bidirectional LSTMs, in order to
generate balanced targets with both good suffixes and good prefixes. The
evaluation results show that the method is able to match and even
surpass the current state-of-the-art on most language pairs, but also
exposes weaknesses on some tasks motivating further study. The Janus
toolkit that was used to build the systems used in the evaluation is
publicly available at https://github.com/lemaoliu/Agtarbidir.
