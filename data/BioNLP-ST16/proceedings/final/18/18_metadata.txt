Abstract#==#We participate in the BB3 and GE4 tasks of BioNLP-ST 2016. In the BB3 task, we
adopt word representation methods to improve the feature-based Biomedical Event
Extraction System, and take the 4th place. In the GE4 task, based on the Uturku
system, a two-stage method is proposed for trigger detection, which divides
trigger detection into recognition stage and classification stage, using
different features in each stage. In the edge detection, we adopt
Passive-aggressive (PA) online algorithm, then we constitute events by
post-processing of TEES.
