Abstract#==#We participate in the two event extraction tasks of BioNLP 2016 Shared Task:
binary relation extraction of SeeDev task and localization relations extraction
of Bacteria Biotope task. Convolutional neural network (CNN) is employed to
model the sentences by convolution and max-pooling operation from raw input
with word embedding. Then, full connected neural network is used to learn
senior and significant features automatically. The proposed model mainly
contains two modules: distributive semantic representation building, such as
word embedding, POS embedding, distance embedding and entity type embedding,
and CNN model training. The results with F-score of 0.370 and 0.478 in our
participant tasks, which were evaluated on the test data set, show that our
proposed method  contributes to binary relation extraction effectively and can
reduce the impact of artificial feature engineering through automatically
feature learning.
