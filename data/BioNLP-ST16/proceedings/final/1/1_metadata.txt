Abstract#==#The number of scientific papers published each year is growing exponentially
and given the rate of this growth, automated information extraction is needed
to efficiently extract information from this corpus. A critical first step in
this process is to accurately recognize the names of entities in text. Previous
efforts, such as SPECIES, have identified bacteria strain names, among other
taxonomic groups, but have been limited to those names present in NCBI
taxonomy. We have implemented a dictionary-based named entity tagger, TagIt,
that is followed by a rule based expansion system to identify bacteria strain
names and habitats and resolve them to the closest match possible in the NCBI
taxonomy and the OntoBiotope ontology respectively. The rule based post
processing steps expand acronyms, and extend strain names according to a set of
rules, which captures additional aliases and strains that are not present in
the dictionary. TagIt has the best performance out of three entries to
BioNLP-ST BB3 cat+ner, with an overall SER of 0.628 on the independent test
set.
