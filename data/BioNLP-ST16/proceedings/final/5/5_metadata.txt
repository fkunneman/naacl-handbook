Abstract#==#We present the Vancouver Event and Relation System for Extraction (VERSE) as a
competing system for three subtasks of the BioNLP Shared Task 2016. VERSE
performs full event extraction including entity, relation and modification
extraction using a feature-based approach with a linear support vector machine
(SVM).It achieved the highest F1-score in the Bacteria Biotope (BB3)
event subtask and the third highest F1-score in the Seed Development (SeeDev)
binary subtask.
