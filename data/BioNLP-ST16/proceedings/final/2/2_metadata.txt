Abstract#==#This paper presents our participation in the Bacteria/Biotope track from the
2016 BioNLP Shared-Task. Our methods rely on a combination of distinct
machine-learning and rule-based systems. We used CRF and post-processing rules
to identify mentions of bacteria and biotopes, a rule-based approach to
normalize the concepts in the ontology and the taxonomy, and SVM to identify
relations between bacteria and biotopes. On the test datasets, we achieved
similar results to those obtained on the development datasets: on the
categorization task, precision of 0.503 (gold standard entities) and SER of
0.827 (both NER and categorization); on the event relation task, F-measure of
0.485 (gold standard entities, ranking third out of 11) and of 0.192 (both NER
and event relation, ranking first); on the knowledge-based task, mean
references of 0.771 (gold standard entities) and of 0.202 (both NER,
categorization and event relation).
