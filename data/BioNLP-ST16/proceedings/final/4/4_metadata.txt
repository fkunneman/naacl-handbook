Abstract#==#This paper describes the system details and results of the participation of the
team from the University of Melbourne in the SeeDev binary event extraction of
BioNLP-Shared Task 2016. This task addresses the extraction of genetic and
molecular mechanisms that regulate plant seed development from the natural
language text of the published literature. In our submission, we developed a
system using a support vector machine classifier with linear kernel powered by
a rich set of features. Our system achieved an F1-score of 36.4%.
