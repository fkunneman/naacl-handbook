Abstract#==#Even a simple biological phenomenon may introduce a complex network of
molecular interactions. Scientific literature is one of the trustful resources
delivering knowledge of these networks. We propose LitWay, a system for
extracting semantic relations from texts. LitWay utilizes a hybrid method that
combines both a rule-based method and a machine learning-based method. It is
tested on the SeeDev task of BioNLP-ST 2016, achieves the state-of-the-art
performance with the F-score of 43.2\%, ranking first of all participating
teams. To further reveal the linguistic characteristics of each event, we test
the system solely with syntactic rules or machine learning, and different
combinations of two methods. We find that it is difficult for one method to
achieve good performance for all semantic relation types due to the
complication of bio-events in the literatures.
