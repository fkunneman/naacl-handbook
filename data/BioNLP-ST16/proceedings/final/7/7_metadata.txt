Abstract#==#This paper describes our system to extract binary regulatory relations from
text, used to participate in the SeeDev task of BioNLP-ST 2016.
Our system was based on machine learning, using support vector machines with
a shallow linguistic kernel to identify each type of relation.
Additionally, we employed a distant supervised approach to increase the size
of the training data.
Our submission obtained the third best precision of the SeeDev-binary task.
Although the distant supervised approach did not significantly improve the
results, we expect that by exploring other techniques to use unlabeled data
should lead to better results.
