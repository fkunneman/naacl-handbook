Abstract#==#We present the TurkuNLP entry to the BioNLP Shared Task 2016 Bacteria Biotope
event extraction (BB3-event) subtask. We propose a deep learning-based approach
to event extraction using a combination of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
networks over syntactic depen- dency graphs. Features for the proposed neural
network are generated based on the shortest path connecting the two candidate
entities in the dependency graph. We fur- ther detail how this network can be
efficiently trained to have good generalization performance even when only a
very limited number of training examples are avail- able and part-of-speech
(POS) and dependency type feature representations must be learned from scratch.
Our method ranked second among the entries to the shared task, achieving an
F-score of 52.1% with 62.3% precision and 44.8% recall.
