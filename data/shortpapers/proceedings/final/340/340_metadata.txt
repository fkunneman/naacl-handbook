Abstract#==#We investigate the effectiveness of semantic generalizations/classifications
for capturing the regularities of the behavior of verbs in terms of their
metaphoricity. Starting from orthographic word unigrams, we experiment with
various ways of defining semantic classes for verbs (grammatical,
resource-based, distributional) and measure the effectiveness of these classes
for classifying all verbs in a running text as metaphor or nonmetaphor.
