Abstract#==#Recently, neural network models have achieved consistent improvements in
statistical machine translation. However, most networks only use one-hot
encoded input vectors of words as their input. In this work, we investigated
the exponentially decaying bag-of-words input features for feed-forward neural
network translation models and proposed to train the decay rates along with
other weight parameters. This novel bag-of-words model improved our
phrase-based state-of-the-art system, which already includes a neural network
translation model, by up to 0.5% Bleu and 0.6% Ter on three different
translation tasks and even achieved a similar performance to the bidirectional
LSTM translation model.
