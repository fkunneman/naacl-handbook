Abstract#==#We present a natural language generator based on the sequence-to-sequence
approach that can be trained to produce natural language strings as well as
deep syntax dependency trees from input dialogue acts, and we use it to
directly compare two-step generation with separate sentence planning and
surface realization stages to a joint, one-step approach.

We were able to train both setups successfully using very little training data.
The joint setup offers better performance, surpassing state-of-the-art with
regards to n-gram-based scores while providing more relevant outputs.
