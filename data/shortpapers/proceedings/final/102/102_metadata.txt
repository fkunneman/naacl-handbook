Abstract#==#Classification of temporal textual data sequences is a common task in various
domains such as social media and the Web. In this paper we propose to use
Hawkes Processes for classifying sequences of temporal textual data, which
exploit both temporal and textual information. Our experiments on rumour stance
classification on four Twitter datasets show the importance of using the
temporal information of tweets along with the textual content.
