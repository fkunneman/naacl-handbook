Abstract#==#L2 learners often produce "ungrammatical" word combinations such as, e.g.,
*give a suggestion or *make a walk. This is because of the "collocationality"
of one of their items (the base) that limits the acceptance of collocates to
express a specific meaning ('perform' above). We propose an algorithm that
delivers, for a given base and the intended meaning of a collocate, the actual
collocate lexeme(s) (make / take above). The algorithm exploits the linear
mapping between bases and collocates from examples and generates a collocation
transformation matrix which is then applied to novel unseen cases. The
evaluation shows a promising line of research in collocation discovery.
