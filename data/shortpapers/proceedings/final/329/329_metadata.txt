Abstract#==#We address the problem of automatically cleaning a large-scale Translation
Memory (TM) in a fully unsupervised fashion, i.e. without human-labelled data.
We approach the task by: i) designing a set of features that capture the
similarity between two text segments in different languages, ii) use them to
induce reliable training labels for a subset of the translation units
(TUs) contained in the TM, and iii) use the automatically labelled data to
train an
ensemble of binary classifiers. We apply our method to clean a test set
composed of 1,000 TUs randomly extracted from the English-Italian version of
MyMemory, the world's largest public TM. Our results show competitive
performance not only against a strong baseline that exploits machine
translation, but also against a state-of-the-art method that relies on
human-labelled data.
