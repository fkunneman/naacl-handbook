Abstract#==#Most previous work on annotation projection has been limited to a subset of
Indo-European languages, using only a single source language, and projecting
annotation for one task at a time. In contrast, we present an Integer Linear
Programming (ILP) algorithm that simultaneously projects annotation for
multiple tasks from multiple source languages, relying on parallel corpora
available for hundreds of languages. When training POS taggers and dependency
parsers on jointly projected POS tags and syntactic dependencies using our
algorithm, we obtain better performance than a standard approach on 20/23
languages using one parallel corpus; and 18/27 languages using another.
