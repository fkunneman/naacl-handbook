Abstract#==#We present a new, structured approach to text simplification using conditional
random fields over top-down traversals of dependency graphs that jointly
predicts possible compressions and paraphrases. Our model reaches readability
scores comparable to word-based compression approaches across a range of
metrics and human judgements while maintaining more of the important
information.
