Abstract#==#In this paper, we propose a method for referring
to the real world to improve named
entity recognition (NER) specialized for a
domain. Our method adds a stacked auto-encoder
to a text-based deep neural network
for NER. We first train the stacked
auto-encoder only from the real world information,
then the entire deep neural network
from sentences annotated with NEs
and accompanied by real world information.
In our experiments, we took Japanese
chess as the example. The dataset consists
of pairs of a game state and commentary
sentences about it annotated with game-specific
NE tags. We conducted NER experiments
and showed that referring to the
real world improves the NER accuracy.
