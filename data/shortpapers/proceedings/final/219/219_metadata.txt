Abstract#==#Access to data is critical to any machine learning component aimed at training
an accurate predictive model. In reality, data is often a subject of technical
and legal constraints. Data may contain sensitive topics and data owners are
often reluctant to share them.
Instead of access to data, they make available decision making procedures to
enable predictions on new data.
Under the black box classifier constraint, we build an effective domain
adaptation technique which
adapts classifier predictions in a transductive setting. We run experiments on
text categorization datasets and show that significant 
gains can be achieved, especially in the unsupervised case where no labels are
available in the target domain.
