Abstract#==#We present a novel technique for training translation models for statistical
machine translation by aligning source sentences to their oracle-BLEU
translations. In contrast to previous approaches which are constrained to
phrase training, our method also allows the re-estimation of re-ordering models
along with the translation model. Experiments show an improvement of up to 0.8
BLEU for our approach over a competitive Arabic-English baseline trained
directly on the word-aligned bitext using heuristic extraction. As an
additional benefit, the phrase table size is reduced dramatically to only 3% of
the original size.
