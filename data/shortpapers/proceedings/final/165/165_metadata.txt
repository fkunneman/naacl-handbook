Abstract#==#We describe an efficient neural network method to automatically learn sentiment
lexicons without relying on any manual resources. The method takes inspiration
from the NRC method, which gives the best results in SemEval13 by leveraging
emoticons in large tweets, using the PMI between words and tweet sentiments to
define the sentiment attributes of words. We show that better lexicons can be
learned by using them to predict the tweet sentiment labels. By using a very
simple neural network, our method is fast and can take advantage of the same
data volume as the NRC method. Experiments show that our lexicons give
significantly better accuracies on multiple languages compared to the current
best methods.
