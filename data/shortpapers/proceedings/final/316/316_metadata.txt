Abstract#==#Recent work has revealed the potential of using visual representations for
bilingual lexicon learning (BLL). Such image-based BLL methods, however, still
fall short of linguistic approaches. In this paper, we propose a simple yet
effective multi-modal approach that learns bilingual semantic representations
that fuse linguistic and visual input. These new bilingual multi-modal
embeddings display significant performance gains in the BLL task for three
language pairs on two benchmarking test sets, outperforming linguistic-only BLL
models using three different types of state-of-the-art bilingual word
embeddings, as well as visual-only BLL models.
