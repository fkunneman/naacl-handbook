Abstract#==#Increasing amounts of digital data in historical linguistics necessitate the
development of automatic methods for the detection of cognate words across
languages.  Recently developed methods work well on language families with
moderate time depths, but they are not capable of identifying cognate morphemes
in words which are only partially related. Partial cognacy, however, is a
frequently recurring phenomenon, especially in language families with
productive derivational morpho- logy. This paper presents a pilot approach for
partial cognate detection in which networks are used to represent similarities
between word parts and cognate morphemes are identified with help of
state-of-the-art algorithms for network partitioning.  The approach is tested
on a newly created benchmark dataset with data from three sub-branches of
Sino-Tibetan and yields very promising results, outperforming all algorithms
which are not sensible to partial cognacy.
