Abstract#==#In the translation industry, human translations are assessed by comparison with
the source texts. In the Machine Translation (MT) research community, however,
it is a common practice to perform quality assessment using a reference
translation instead of the source text. In this paper we show that this
practice has a serious issue - annotators are strongly biased by the reference
translation provided, and this can have a negative impact on the assessment of
MT quality.
