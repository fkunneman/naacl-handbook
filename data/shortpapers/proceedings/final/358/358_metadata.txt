Abstract#==#In this paper, we propose LexVec, a new method for generating distributed word
representations that uses low-rank, weighted factorization of the Positive
Point-wise Mutual Information matrix via stochastic gradient descent, employing
%of the PPMI matrix that generates a weighting scheme that assigns heavier
penalties for errors on frequent co-occurrences while still accounting for
negative co-occurrence. Evaluation on word similarity and analogy tasks shows
that LexVec matches and often outperforms state-of-the-art methods on many of
these tasks.
