Abstract#==#We present an open web platform for developing, compiling, and running
rule-based speech to sign language translation applications. Speech recognition
is performed using the Nuance Recognizer 10.2 toolkit, and signed output,
including both manual and non-manual components, is rendered using the
JASigning avatar system. The platform is designed to make the component
technologies readily accessible to sign language experts who are not
necessarily computer scientists. Translation grammars are written in a version
of Synchronous Context-Free Grammar adapted to the peculiarities of sign
language. All processing is carried out on a remote server, with content
uploaded and accessed through a web interface. Initial experiences show that
simple translation grammars can be implemented on a time-scale of a few hours
to a few days and produce signed output readily comprehensible to Deaf
informants. Overall, the platform drastically lowers the barrier to entry for
researchers interested in building applications that generate high-quality
signed language.
