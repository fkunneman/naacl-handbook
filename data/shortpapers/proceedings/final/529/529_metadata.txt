Abstract#==#In this paper we improve over the hierarchical Pitman-Yor processes language
model in a cross-domain setting by adding skipgrams as features.
We find that adding skipgram features reduces the perplexity. This reduction is
substantial when models are trained on a generic corpus and tested on
domain-specific corpora. We also find that within-domain testing and
cross-domain testing require different backoff strategies.
We observe a 30-40% reduction in perplexity in a cross-domain language
modelling task, and up to 6% reduction in a within-domain experiment, for both
English and Flemish-Dutch.
