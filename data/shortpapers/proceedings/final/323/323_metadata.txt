Abstract#==#We automatically predict properties of wines on the basis of smell and flavor
descriptions from experts' wine reviews.We show wine experts are capable of
describing their  smell and flavor experiences in wine reviews in a
sufficiently consistent manner, such that we can use their descriptions to
predict properties of a wine based solely on language. 
The experimental results show promising F-scores when using lexical and
semantic information to predict the color, grape variety, country of origin,
and price of a wine. This demonstrates, contrary to popular opinion, that wine
experts' reviews really are informative.
