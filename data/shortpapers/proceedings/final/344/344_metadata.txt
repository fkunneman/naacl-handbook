Abstract#==#In word alignment certain source words
are only needed for fluency reasons and
do not have a translation on the target side.
Most word alignment models assume a tar-
get NULL word from which they gener-
ate these untranslatable source words. Hy-
pothesising a target NULL word is not
without problems, however. For example,
because this NULL word has a position, it
interferes with the distribution over align-
ment jumps. We present a word align-
ment model that accounts for untrans-
latable source words by generating them
from preceding source words. It thereby
removes the need for a target NULL word
and only models alignments between word
pairs that are actually observed in the data.
Translation experiments on English paired
with Czech, German, French and Japanese
show that the model outperforms its tradi-
tional IBM counterparts in terms of BLEU
score.
