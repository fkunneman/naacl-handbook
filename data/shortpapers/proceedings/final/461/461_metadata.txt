Abstract#==#Bilingual models that capture the semantics of sentences are typically only 
evaluated on cross-lingual transfer tasks such as cross-lingual document
categorization or machine translation. In this work, we evaluate the quality of
the monolingual representations learned with a variant of the bilingual
compositional model of Hermann and Blunsom (2014), when viewing translations in
a second language as a semantic annotation as the original language text. We
show that compositional objectives based on phrase translation pairs outperform
compositional objectives based on bilingual sentences and on monolingual
paraphrases.
