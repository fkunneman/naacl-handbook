Abstract#==#This paper studies the effect of limited precision data representation and
computation on word embeddings. We present a systematic evaluation of word
embeddings with limited memory and discuss methods that directly train the
limited precision representation with limited memory. Our results show that it
is possible to use and train an $8$-bit fixed-point value for word embedding
without loss of performance in word/phrase similarity and dependency parsing
tasks.
