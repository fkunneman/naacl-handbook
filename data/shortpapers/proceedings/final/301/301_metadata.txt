Abstract#==#The aim of this paper is to investigate suitable evaluation strategies for the
task of word-level quality estimation of machine translation. 
We suggest various metrics to replace $F_1$-score for the ``BAD'' class, which
is currently used as main metric.
We compare the metrics' performance on real system outputs and synthetically
generated datasets and suggest a reliable alternative to the $F_1$-BAD score
--- the multiplication of $F_1$-scores for different classes. Other metrics
have lower discriminative power and are biased by unfair labellings.
