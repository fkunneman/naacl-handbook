Abstract#==#We consider two graph models of semantic change. The first is a time-series
model that relates embedding vectors from one time period to embedding vectors
of previous time periods. In the second, we construct one graph for each word:
nodes
in this graph correspond to time points and edge weights to the similarity of
the
word's meaning across two time points. We apply our two models to corpora
across three different languages. We find that semantic change is linear in two
senses. Firstly, today’s embedding vectors (= meaning) of words can be
derived as
linear combinations of embedding vectors of their neighbors in previous time
periods. Secondly, self-similarity of words decays linearly in time. We
consider both findings as new laws/hypotheses of semantic change.
