Abstract#==#Decision-making is often dependent on uncertain data, e.g. data associated with
confidence scores or  probabilities. We present a  comparison of different
information presentations for uncertain data and, for the first time, measure
their effects on human decision-making. 
We show that the use of Natural Language Generation (NLG) improves
decision-making under uncertainty, compared to              state-of-the-art
graphical-based representation methods. In a task-based study with 442 adults,
we found that  presentations using NLG lead to 24% better decision-making on
average than the graphical presentations, and to 44% better decision-making
when NLG is combined with graphics. We also show that women achieve
significantly better results when   presented with NLG output (an  87\%
increase on average compared to graphical presentations).
