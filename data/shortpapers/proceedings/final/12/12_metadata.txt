Abstract#==#Machine comprehension tests the system's ability to understand a piece of text
through a reading comprehension task. For this task, we propose an approach
using the Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) formalism. We construct meaning
representation graphs for the given text and for each question-answer pair by
merging the AMRs of comprising sentences using cross-sentential phenomena such
as coreference and rhetorical structures. Then, we reduce machine comprehension
to a graph containment problem. We posit that there is a latent mapping of the
question-answer meaning representation graph onto the text meaning
representation graph that explains the answer. We present a unified max-margin
framework that learns to find this mapping (given a corpus of texts and
question-answer pairs), and uses what it learns to answer questions on novel
texts. We show that this approach leads to state of the art results on the
task.
