Abstract#==#We describe a model which jointly performs word segmentation and induces vowel
categories from formant values. Vowel induction performance improves slightly
over a baseline model which does not segment; segmentation performance
decreases slightly from a baseline using entirely symbolic input. Our high
joint performance in this idealized setting implies that problems in
unsupervised speech recognition reflect the phonetic variability of real speech
sounds in context.
