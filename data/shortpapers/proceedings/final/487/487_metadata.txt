Abstract#==#In this paper we study how to identify persuasive posts in online forum
discussions, using data from Change My View sub-Reddit. Our analysis confirms
that the users' voting score for a comment is highly correlated with its
metadata information such as published time and author reputation. In this
work, we propose and evaluate other features to rank comments based on their
persuasive scores, including textual information in the comment and social
interaction related features. Our experiments show that the surface textual
features do not perform well compared to the argumentation based features, and
the social interaction based features are effective especially when more users
participate in the discussion.
