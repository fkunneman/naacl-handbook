Abstract#==#Relation classification is an important semantic processing task in the field
of natural language processing (NLP). State-of-the-art systems still rely on
lexical resources such as WordNet or NLP systems like dependency parser and
named entity recognizers (NER) to get high-level features. Another challenge is
that important information can appear at any position in the sentence. To
tackle these problems, we propose Attention-Based Bidirectional Long Short-Term
Memory Networks(Att-BLSTM) to capture the most important semantic information
in a sentence. The experimental results on the SemEval-2010 relation
classification task show that our method outperforms most of the existing
methods, with only word vectors.
