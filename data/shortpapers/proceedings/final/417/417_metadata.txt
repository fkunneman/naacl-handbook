Abstract#==#We present a named entity recognition (NER) system for tagging fiction: LitNER.
Relative to more traditional approaches, litNER has two important properties:
(1) it makes use of no hand-tagged data or gazetteers, instead bootstrapping
from term clusters; and (2) it leverages multiple instances of the same name in
a text. Our experiments show it to substantially outperform off-the-shelf
supervised NER systems.
