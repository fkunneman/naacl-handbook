Abstract#==#Recent work in learning vector-space embeddings for multi-relational data 
has focused on combining relational information derived from knowledge bases
with distributional information derived from large text corpora. 
We propose a simple approach that leverages the descriptions of entities or
phrases available
in lexical resources, in conjunction with distributional semantics, in order
to derive a better initialization for training relational models. Applying this
initialization to the TransE model results in significant new state-of-the-art
performances on the WordNet dataset, decreasing the mean rank from the previous
best 212 to 51. It also results in faster convergence of the entity
representations, and achieves small improvements on Freebase for raw mean rank.
 We find that there is a trade-off between improving the mean rank and the
hits@10 with this approach. This illustrates that much remains to be understood
regarding performance improvements in relational models.
