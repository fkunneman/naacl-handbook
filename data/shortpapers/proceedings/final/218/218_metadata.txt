Abstract#==#Finding domain invariant features is critical for successful domain adaptation
and transfer learning.
However, in the case of unsupervised adaptation, there is a significant risk of
overfitting on source training data.
Recently, a regularization for domain adaptation was proposed for deep models
by Ganin and Lempitsky.
We build on their work by suggesting a more appropriate regularization for
denoising autoencoders.
Our model remains unsupervised and can be computed in closed form.
On standard text classification adaptation tasks, our approach yield state of
the art results, with an important reduction of the learning cost.
