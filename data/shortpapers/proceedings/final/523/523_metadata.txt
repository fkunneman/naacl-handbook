Abstract#==#Nowadays, many scholarly messages are posted on Chinese microblogs and more and
more researchers tend to find scholarly information on microblogs. In order to
exploit microblogging to benefit scientific research, we propose a scholarly
microblog recommendation system in this study. It automatically collects and
mines scholarly information from Chinese microblogs, and makes personalized
recommendations to researchers. We propose two different neural network models
which learn the vector representations for both users and microblog texts. Then
the recommendation is accomplished based on the similarity between a user’s
vector and a microblog text’s vector. We also build a dataset for this task.
The two embedding models are evaluated on the dataset and show good results
compared to several baselines.
