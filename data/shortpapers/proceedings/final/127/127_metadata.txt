Abstract#==#Prominent semantic annotations take an inclusive approach to argument span
annotation, marking arguments as full constituency subtrees. Some works,
however, showed that identifying a reduced argument span can be beneficial for
various semantic tasks. While certain practical methods do extract reduced
argument spans, such as in Open-IE, these solutions are often ad-hoc and
system-dependent, with no commonly accepted standards. In this paper we propose
a generic argument reduction criterion, along with an annotation procedure, and
show that it can be consistently and intuitively annotated using the recent
QA-SRL paradigm.
