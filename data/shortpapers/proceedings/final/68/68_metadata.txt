Abstract#==#We decompose a standard embedding space into interpretable orthogonal
subspaces, including a one-dimensional polarity subspace as well as
concreteness, frequency and part-of-speech (POS) subspaces. We introduce a new
calculus for subspaces that supports operations like “−1 × hate = love”
and “give me a neutral word for greasy” (i.e., oleaginous). This calculus
extends analogy computations like “king − man + woman = queen”. For the
tasks of Antonym Classification and POS Tagging our method outperforms the
state of the art. We create new test sets for Morphological Analogies and for
the task of Polarity Spectrum Creation.
