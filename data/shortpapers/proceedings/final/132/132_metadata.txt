Abstract#==#We present a neural network based automatic post-editing (APE) system to
improve raw machine translation (MT) output. Our neural model of APE (NNAPE) is
based on a bidirectional recurrent neural network (RNN) model and consists of
an encoder that encodes an MT output into a fixed-length vector from which a
decoder provides a post-edited (PE) translation. 
APE translations produced by NNAPE showed statistically significant
improvements of 3.96, 2.68 and 1.35 BLEU points over the original MT,
phrase-based APE and hierarchical APE outputs, respectively. Furthermore, human
evaluation also revealed that the NNAPE generated PE translations are much
better than the original MT output.
