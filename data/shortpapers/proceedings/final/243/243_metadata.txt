Abstract#==#Recent comparative studies have demonstrated the usefulness of dependency-based
contexts (DEPS) for learning distributed word representations for similarity
tasks. In English, DEPS tend to perform better than the more common, less
informed bag-of-words contexts (BOW). In this paper, we present the first
cross-linguistic comparison of different context types for three different
languages. DEPS are extracted from ``universal parses'' without any
language-specific optimization. Our results suggest that the universal DEPS
(UDEPS) are useful for detecting functional similarity (e.g., verb similarity,
solving syntactic analogies) among languages, but their advantage over BOW is
not as prominent as previously reported on English. We also show that simple
``post-parsing'' filtering of useful UDEPS contexts leads to consistent
improvements across languages.
