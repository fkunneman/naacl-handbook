Abstract#==#Scoring the quality of persuasive essays is an important goal of discourse
analysis, addressed most recently with high-level persuasion-related features
such as thesis clarity, or opinions and their targets.              We investigate
whether
argumentation features derived from a coarse-grained argumentative structure of
essays can help predict essays scores. We introduce a set of argumentation
features related to argument components (e.g., the number of claims and
premises), argument relations (e.g., the number of supported claims) and
typology of argumentative structure (chains, trees). We show that these
features are good predictors of human scores for TOEFL essays, both when the
coarse-grained argumentative structure is manually annotated and automatically
predicted.
