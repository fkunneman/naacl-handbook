Abstract#==#Modern coreference resolution systems require linguistic and general knowledge
typically sourced from costly, manually curated resources. Despite their
intuitive appeal, results have been mixed. In this work, we instead implement
fine-grained surface-level features motivated by cognitive theory. Our novel
fine-grained feature specialisation approach significantly improves the
performance of a strong baseline, achieving state-of-the-art results of 65.29
and 61.13% on CoNLL 2012 using gold and automatic preprocessing, with system
extracted mentions.
