Abstract#==#Cross-lingual word embeddings are used for cross-lingual information retrieval
or domain adaptations. In this paper, we extend Eigenwords, spectral
monolingual word embeddings based on canonical correlation analysis (CCA), to
cross-lingual settings with sentence-alignment. For incorporating cross-lingual
information, CCA is replaced with its generalization based on the spectral
graph embeddings. The proposed method, which we refer to as Cross-Lingual
Eigenwords (CL-Eigenwords), is fast and scalable for computing distributed
representations of words via eigenvalue decomposition. Numerical experiments of
English-Spanish word translation tasks show that CL-Eigenwords is competitive
with state-of-the-art cross-lingual word embedding methods.
