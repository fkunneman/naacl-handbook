Abstract#==#Here we seek to automatically identify Hungarian patients suffering from mild
cognitive impairment (MCI) based on linguistic features collected from their
speech transcripts. Our system uses machine learning techniques and is based on
several linguistic features like characteristics of spontaneous speech as well
as features exploiting morphological and syntactic parsing. Our results suggest
that it is primarily morphological and speech-based features that help
distinguish MCI patients from healthy controls.
