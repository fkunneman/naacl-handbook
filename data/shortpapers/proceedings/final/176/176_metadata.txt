Abstract#==#Dimensional sentiment analysis aims to recognize continuous numerical values
in multiple dimensions such as the valence-arousal (VA) space. Compared to the
categorical approach that focuses on sentiment classification such as binary
classification (i.e., positive and negative), the dimensional approach can
provide more fine-grained sentiment analysis. This study proposes a regional
CNN-LSTM model consisting of two parts: regional CNN and LSTM to predict the VA
ratings of texts. Unlike a conventional CNN which considers a whole text as
input, the proposed regional CNN uses an individual sentence as a region,
dividing an input text into several regions such that the useful affective
information in each region can be extracted and weighted according to their
contribution to the VA prediction. Such regional information is sequentially
integrated across regions using LSTM for VA prediction. By combining the
regional CNN and LSTM, both local (regional) information within sentences and
long-distance dependency across sentences can be considered in the prediction
process. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms
lexicon-based, regression-based, and NN-based methods proposed in previous
studies.
