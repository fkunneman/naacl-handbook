Abstract#==#This paper presents a novel approach to automated sentence completion based on
pointwise mutual information (PMI). Feature sets are created by fusing the
various types of input provided to other classes of language models, ultimately
allowing multiple sources of both local and distant information to be
considered. Furthermore, it is shown that additional precision gains may be
achieved by incorporating feature sets of higher-order n-grams. Experimental
results demonstrate that the PMI model outperforms all prior models and
establishes a new state-of-the-art result on the Microsoft Research Sentence
Completion Challenge.
