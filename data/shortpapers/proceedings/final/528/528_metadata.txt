Abstract#==#The enormous scale of unlabeled text available today necessitates scalable
schemes for representation learning in natural language processing. For
instance, in this paper we are interested in classifying the intent of a user
query. While our labeled data is quite limited, we have access to virtually an
unlimited amount of unlabeled queries, which could be used to induce useful
representations: for instance by principal component analysis(PCA). However, it
is prohibitive to even store the data in memory due to its sheer
size, let alone apply conventional batch algorithms. In this work, we apply the
recently proposed matrix sketching algorithm to entirely obviate the problem
with
scalability (Liberty, 2013). This algorithm approximates the data within a
specified memory bound while preserving the covariance structure necessary for
PCA. Using matrix sketching, we significantly improve the user intent
classification accuracy by leveraging large amounts of unlabeled queries.
