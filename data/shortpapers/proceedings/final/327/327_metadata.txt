Abstract#==#As a first step towards agents learning to
communicate about their visual environment, 
we propose a system that, given visual representations 
of a referent (cat) and a context (sofa), identifies their discriminative
attributes, i.e., properties that distinguish them (has_tail). Moreover, 
despite the lack of direct supervision at the attribute level, the model
learns to assign plausible attributes to objects (sofa-has_cushion). Finally,
we present a preliminary experiment confirming the referential success of the
predicted discriminative attributes.
