Abstract#==#Constrained translation has improved statistical machine translation (SMT) by
combining it with translation memory (TM) at sentence-level. In this paper, we
propose using a constrained word lattice, which encodes input phrases and TM
constraints together, to combine SMT and TM at phrase-level. Experiments on
English--Chinese and English--French show that our approach is significantly
better than previous combination methods, including sentence-level constrained
translation and a recent phrase-level combination.
