Abstract#==#We demonstrate the value of collecting semantic parse labels for knowledge base
question answering. In particular, (1) unlike previous studies on small-scale
datasets, we show that learning from labeled semantic parses significantly
improves overall performance, resulting in absolute 5 point gain compared to
learning from answers, (2) we show that with an appropriate user interface, one
can obtain semantic parses with high accuracy and at a cost comparable or lower
than obtaining just answers, and (3) we have created and shared the largest
semantic-parse labeled dataset to date in order to advance research in question
answering.
