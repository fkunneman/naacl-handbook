Abstract#==#Traditional topic models do not account for semantic regularities in language. 
Recent distributional representations of words exhibit semantic consistency
over directional metrics such as cosine similarity. 
However, neither categorical nor Gaussian observational distributions used in
existing topic models are appropriate to leverage such correlations.
In this paper, we propose to use the von Mises-Fisher distribution to model the
density of words over a unit sphere. Such a representation is well-suited for
directional data. We use a Hierarchical Dirichlet Process for our base topic
model and propose an efficient inference algorithm based on Stochastic
Variational Inference. This model enables us to naturally exploit the semantic
structures of word embeddings while flexibly discovering the number of topics.
Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms three competitive
approaches in terms of topic coherence on two different text corpora while
offering efficient inference.
