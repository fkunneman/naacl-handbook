Abstract#==#Using corpus data of spoken dialogue, we examine the convergence of syntactic
complexity levels between interlocutors in natural conversations, as it occurs
within spans of topic episodes. The findings of general convergence in the
Switchboard and BNC corpora are compatible with an information-theoretic model
of dialogue and with Interactive Alignment Theory.
