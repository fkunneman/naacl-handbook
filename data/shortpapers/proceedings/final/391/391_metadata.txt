Abstract#==#Over the past decade, e-Commerce has rapidly grown enabling customers to
purchase products with the click of a button. But to be able to do so, one has
to understand the semantics of a user query and identify that in "digital
lifestyle tv", "digital lifestyle" is a brand and "tv" is a product. 

In this paper, we develop a series of structured prediction algorithms for
semantic tagging of shopping queries with the "product", "brand", "model" and
"product family" types. We model wide variety of features and show an
alternative way to capture knowledge base information using embeddings. We
conduct an extensive study over 37,000 manually annotated queries and report
performance of 90.92 F1 independent of the query length.
