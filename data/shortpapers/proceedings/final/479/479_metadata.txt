Abstract#==#There are different definitions of what a troll is. Certainly, a troll can be
somebody who teases people to make them angry, or somebody who offends people,
or somebody who wants to dominate any single discussion, or somebody who tries
to manipulate peopleâ€™s opinion (sometimes for money), etc. The last
definition is the one that dominates the public discourse in Bulgaria and
Eastern Europe, and this is our focus in this paper.

In our work, we examine two types of opinion manipulation trolls: paid trolls
that have been revealed from leaked "reputation management contracts" and
"mentioned trolls" that have been called such by several different people. We
show that these definitions are sensible: we build two classifiers that can
distinguish a post by such a paid troll from one by a non-troll with 81-82%
accuracy; the same classifier also achieves 81-82% accuracy on so called
mentioned troll vs. non-troll posts.
