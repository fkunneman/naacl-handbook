Abstract#==#Event detection remains a challenge due to the difficulty at encoding the word
semantics in various contexts.
Previous approaches heavily depend on language-specific knowledge and 
pre-existing natural language processing (NLP) tools.
However, compared to English, not all languages have such resources and  tools
available.
A more promising approach is to automatically learn effective features from
data, without relying on language-specific resources.
In this paper, we develop a hybrid neural network to 
capture both sequence and chunk information from specific contexts, and use
them to train an event detector for multiple languages without any manually
encoded features.
Experiments show that
our approach can achieve robust, efficient and accurate results for multiple
languages (English, Chinese and Spanish).
