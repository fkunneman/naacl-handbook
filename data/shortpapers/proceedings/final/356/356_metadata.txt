Abstract#==#We present a new annotation method for collecting data on relation inference in
context. We convert the inference task to one of simple factoid question
answering, allowing us to easily scale up to 16,000 high-quality examples. Our
method corrects a major bias in previous evaluations, making our dataset much
more realistic.
