Abstract#==#Retrieving similar short texts is crucial to many applications, e.g., web
search, microblogging, ads matching, and so forth. Most of the traditional
methods concentrate on how to improve the precision of the similarity
measurement, while current real applications need to efficiently explore the
top similar short texts semantically related to the query one. In this paper,
we address the efficiency issue by investigating the similarity strategies and
incorporating them into the FAST framework (efficient FrAmework for semantic
similar Short Texts retrieval). We conduct comprehensive performance evaluation
on real-life data which shows that our proposal outperforms the
state-of-the-art techniques.
