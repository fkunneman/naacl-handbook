Abstract#==#Recently, many neural network models have been applied to Chinese word
segmentation. However, such models focus more on collecting local information
while long distance dependencies are not well learned. To integrate local
features with long distance dependencies, we propose a dependency-based gated
recursive neural network. Local features are first collected by bi-directional
long short term memory network, then combined and refined to long distance
dependencies via gated recursive neural network. Experimental results show that
our model is a competitive model for Chinese word segmentation.
