Abstract#==#Incorporating lexical knowledge from semantic resources (e.g., WordNet ) has
been shown to improve the quality of distributed word representations. This
knowledge often comes in the form of relational triplets (x; r; y) where words
x and y are connected by a relation type r. Existing methods either ignore the
relation types, essentially treating the word pairs as generic related words,
or employ rather restrictive assumptions to model the relational knowledge. We
propose a novel approach to model relational knowledge based on low-rank
subspace regularization, and conduct experiments on standard tasks to evaluate
its effectiveness.
