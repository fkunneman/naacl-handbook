Abstract#==#This work explores the use of unsupervised morph segmentation along with
statistical language models for the task of vocabulary expansion. Unsupervised
vocabulary expansion has large potential for improving vocabulary coverage and
performance in different natural language processing tasks, especially in
less-resourced settings on morphologically rich languages. We propose a
combination of unsupervised morph segmentation and statistical language models
and evaluate on languages from the Babel corpus. The method is shown to perform
well for all the evaluated languages when compared to the previous work on the
task.
