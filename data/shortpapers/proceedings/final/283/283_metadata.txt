Abstract#==#This paper presents a parsing algorithm that can jointly detect empty elements.
This method uses the spinal Tree Adjoining Grammar formalism of (Carreras, et.
al. 08).
In this paper, we define a transition-based algorithm together with several
operations
to combine the spinal elementary trees for constructing a full parse tree with
empty elements.
We conduct experiments on the English Penn and the Japanese Keyaki Treebank
datasets.
The experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms the previous
systems.
