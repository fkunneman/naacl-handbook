Abstract#==#We present improvements to our incremental proposition-based summariser, which
is inspired by Kintsch and van Dijk's (1978) text comprehension model. Argument
overlap is a central concept in this summariser. Our new model replaces the old
overlap method based on distributional similarity with one based on lexical
chains. We evaluate on a new corpus of 124 summaries of educational texts, and
show that our new system outperforms the old method and several
state-of-the-art non-proposition-based summarisers. The experiment also
verifies that the incremental nature of memory cycles is beneficial in itself,
by comparing it to a non-incremental algorithm using the same underlying
information.
