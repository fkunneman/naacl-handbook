Abstract#==#We propose a framework to model human
comprehension of discourse connectives.
Following the Bayesian pragmatic paradiagm,
we advocate that discourse connectives
are interpreted based on a simulation
of the production process by the speaker,
who, in turn, considers the ease of interpretation
for the listener when choosing
connectives. Evaluation against the sense
annotation of the Penn Discourse Treebank
confirms the superiority of the model
over literal comprehension. A further experiment
demonstrates that the proposed
model also improves automatic discourse
parsing.
