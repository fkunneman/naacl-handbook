Abstract#==#Finding quality descriptions on the web, such as those found in Wikipedia
articles, of newer companies can be difficult: search engines show many pages
with varying relevance, while multi-document summarization algorithms find it
difficult to distinguish between core facts and other information such as news
stories. In this paper, we propose an entity-focused, hybrid generation
approach to automatically produce descriptions of previously unseen companies,
and show that it outperforms a strong summarization baseline.
