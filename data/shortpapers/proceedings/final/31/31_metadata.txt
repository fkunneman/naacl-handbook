Abstract#==#Syntactic parsers perform poorly in prediction of Argument-Cluster Coordination
(ACC).
We change the PTB representation of ACC to be more suitable for learning by a
statistical PCFG parser, affecting 125 trees in the training set.
Training on the modified trees yields a slight improvement in EVALB scores on
sections 22 and 23. The main evaluation is on a corpus of 4th grade science
exams, in which ACC structures are prevalent.  On this corpus, we obtain an
impressive $\times$2.7 improvement in recovering ACC structures compared to a
parser trained on the original PTB trees.
