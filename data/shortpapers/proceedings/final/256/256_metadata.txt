Abstract#==#This paper addresses an automatic classification of preposition
types in German, comparing hard and soft clustering approaches and
various window- and syntax-based co-occurrence features. We show
that (i) the semantically most salient preposition features (i.e.,
subcategorised nouns) are the most successful, and that (ii) soft
clustering approaches are required for the task but reveal quite
different attitudes towards predicting ambiguity.
