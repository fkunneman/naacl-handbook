Abstract#==#Writing style allows NLP tools to adjust to the traits of an author.
In this paper, we explore the relation between stylistic and syntactic features
and authors' age and income. We confirm our hypothesis that for numerous
feature types writing style is predictive of income even beyond age.
We analyze the predictive power of writing style features in a regression task
on two data sets of around 5,000 Twitter users each. Additionally, we use our
validated features to study daily variations in writing style of users from
distinct income groups. Temporal stylistic patterns not only provide novel
psychological insight into user behavior, but are useful for future research
and applications in social media.
