Abstract#==#Bidirectional long short-term memory (bi-LSTM) networks have recently proven
successful for various NLP sequence modeling tasks, but little is known about
their reliance to input representations, target languages, data set size, and
label noise. 
We address these issues and evaluate bi-LSTMs with word, character, and unicode
byte embeddings for POS tagging. We compare bi-LSTMs to traditional POS taggers
across languages and data sizes. We also present a novel bi-LSTM model, which
combines the POS tagging loss function with an auxiliary loss function that
accounts for rare words. The model obtains state-of-the-art performance across
22 languages, and works especially well for morphologically complex languages.
Our analysis suggests that bi-LSTMs are less sensitive to training data size
and label corruptions (at small noise levels) than previously assumed.
