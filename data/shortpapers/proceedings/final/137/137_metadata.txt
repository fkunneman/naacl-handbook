Abstract#==#We provide a solution for elementary science test using instructional
materials. We posit that there is a hidden structure that explains the
correctness of an answer given the question and instructional materials and
present a unified max-margin framework that learns to find these hidden
structures (given a corpus of question-answer pairs and instructional
materials), and uses what it learns to answer novel elementary science
questions. Our evaluation shows that our framework outperforms several strong
baselines.
