Abstract#==#This paper presents the systems submitted by the Abu-MaTran project to the
English-to-Finnish language pair at the WMT 2016 news translation task. We
applied morphological segmentation and deep learning in order to address (i)
the data scarcity problem caused by the lack of in-domain parallel data in the
constrained task and (ii) the complex morphology of Finnish. We submitted a
neural machine translation system, a statistical machine translation system
reranked with a neural language model and the combination of their outputs
tuned on character sequences. The combination and the neural system were ranked
first and second respectively according to automatic evaluation metrics and
tied for the first place in the human evaluation.
