Abstract#==#Recently, the capability of character-level evaluation measures for machine
translation output has been confirmed by several metrics. This work proposes
translation edit rate on character level (CharacTer), which calculates the
character level edit distance while performing the shift edit on word level.
The novel metric shows high system-level correlation with human rankings,
especially for morphologically rich languages. It outperforms the strong CHRF
by up to 7% correlation on different metric tasks. In addition, we apply the
hypothesis sentence length for normalizing the edit distance in CharacTer,
which also provides significant improvements compared to using the reference
sentence length.
