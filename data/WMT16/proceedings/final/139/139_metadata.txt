Abstract#==#This paper provides an overview of the PROMT submissions for the WMT16 Shared
Translation Tasks. We participated in seven language pairs with three different
system configurations (rule-based, statistical and hybrid). We describe the
architecture of the three configurations. We show that fast and accurate
customization of the rule-based system can increase the
BLEU scores significantly.
