Abstract#==#Neural network language and translation
models have recently shown their great potentials
in improving the performance of
phrase-based machine translation. At the
same time, word representations using different
word factors have been translation
quality and are part of many state-of-theart
machine translation systems. used in
many state-of-the-art machine translation
systems, in order to support better translation
quality.
In this work, we combined these two ideas
by investigating the combination of both
techniques. By representing words in neural
network language models using different
factors, we were able to improve the
models themselves as well as their impact
on the overall machine translation performance.
This is especially helpful for morphologically
rich languages due to their
large vocabulary size. Furthermore, it is
easy to add additional knowledge, such as
source side information, to the model.
Using this model we improved the translation
quality of a state-of-the-art phrasebased
machine translation system by 0.7
BLEU points. We performed experiments
on three language pairs for the news translation
task of the WMT 2016 evaluation.
