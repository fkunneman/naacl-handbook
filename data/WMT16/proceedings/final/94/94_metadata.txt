Abstract#==#The article describes LIMSI's submission to the first WMT'16 shared
biomedical translation task, focusing on the sole English-French
translation direction. Our main submission is the output of a
Moses-based statistical machine translation (SMT) system, rescored
with Structured OUtput Layer (SOUL) neural network models. We also
present an attempt to circumvent syntactic complexity: our proposal
combines the outputs of PBSMT systems trained either to translate
entire source sentences or specific syntactic constructs extracted
from those sentences. The approach is implemented using
Confusion Network (CN) decoding. The quality of the combined output
is comparable to the quality of our main system.
