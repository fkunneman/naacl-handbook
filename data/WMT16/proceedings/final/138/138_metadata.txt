Abstract#==#In this paper, we attempt to improve Statistical Machine Translation (SMT)
systems between Czech and English. To accomplish this, we performed translation
model training, created adaptations of training settings for each language
pair, and obtained comparable corpora for our SMT systems. Innovative tools and
data adaptation techniques were employed. Only the official parallel text
corpora and monolingual models for the WMT 2016 evaluation campaign were used
to train language models, and to develop, tune, and test the system. We
explored the use of domain adaptation techniques, symmetrized word alignment
models, the unsupervised transliteration models and the KenLM language modeling
tool. To evaluate the effects of different preparations on translation results,
we conducted experiments and used the BLEU, NIST and TER metrics. Our results
indicate that our approach produced a positive impact on SMT quality.
