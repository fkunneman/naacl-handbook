Abstract#==#This paper describes the submission of the AMU (Adam Mickiewicz University)
team to the Automatic Post-Editing (APE) task of WMT 2016. We explore the
application of neural translation models to the APE problem and achieve good
results by treating different models as components in a log-linear model,
allowing for multiple inputs (the MT-output and the source) that are decoded to
the same target language (post-edited translations).
A simple string-matching penalty integrated within the log-linear model is used
to control for higher faithfulness with regard to the raw machine translation
output.
To overcome the problem of too little training data, we generate large amounts
of artificial data. Our submission improves over the uncorrected baseline on
the unseen test set by -3.2% TER and +5.5% BLEU and outperforms any other
system submitted to the shared-task by a large margin.
