Abstract#==#This paper presents baseline models using linear classifiers for the pronoun
translation task at WMT 2016. We explore various local context features and
include history features of potential antecedents extracted by means of a
simple PoS-matching strategy. The results show the difficulties of the task in
general but also represent valuable baselines to compare other more-informed
systems with. Our experiments reveal that the predictions of English
correspondences for given ambiguous pronouns in French and German is easier
than the other way around. This seems to verify that predictions, which need to
follow more complex agreement constraints, require more reliable information
about the referential links of the tokens to be inserted.
