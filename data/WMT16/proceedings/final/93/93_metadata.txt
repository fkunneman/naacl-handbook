Abstract#==#This paper describes ILSP-ARC-pv42, the Institute for Language and Speech
Processing/Athena Research and Innovation Center submission for the WMT 2016
Bilingual Document Alignment shared task. We describe several document and
collection-aware features that our system explored in the context of the task.
On the test dataset, our submission achieved a recall of 84.93%, even though it
does not make use of any language-specific resources like bilingual lexica or
MT output. Instead, our system is based on shallow features (including links to
documents in the same webdomain, URLs, digits, image filenames and HTML
structure) that can be easily extracted from web documents. We also present
examples to show that when de-duplication issues in the test dataset are
properly addressed, our system reaches a significantly higher recall of 92.5%.
