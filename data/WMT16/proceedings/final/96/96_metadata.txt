Abstract#==#This paper describes Yandex School of Data Analysis (YSDA) submission for
WMT2016 Shared Task on Quality Estimation (QE) / Task 1: Sentence-level
prediction of post-editing effort. We solve the problem of quality estimation
by using a machine learning approach, where we try to learn a regressor from
feature space to HTER score. By enriching the baseline features with the
syntactical features and additional translation system based features, we
achieve Pearson correlation of 0.525 on the test set.
