Abstract#==#This paper describes the submission of the UGENT-LT3 SCATE system to the WMT16
Shared Task on Quality Estimation (QE), viz. English-German word and
sentence-level QE. Based on the observation that the data set is homogeneous
(all sentences belong to the IT domain), we performed bilingual terminology
extraction and added features derived from the result-ing term list to the
well-performing features of the word-level QE task of last year. For
sentence-level QE, we analyzed the importance of the features and based on
those insights extended the feature set of last year. We also experimented with
different learning methods and ensembles. We present our observations from the
different experiments we conducted and our submissions for both tasks.
