Abstract#==#We describe University of Sheffield's submission to the word-level Quality
Estimation shared task. Our system is based on imitation learning, an approach
to structured prediction which relies on a classifier and artificially
generated data. Compared to other traditional algorithms for the same problem,
it allows the use of arbitrary information from previous tag predictions and
the use of non-decomposable losses over the structure. We explore these two
concepts in our submission while using the baseline features provided by the
shared task organizers. Our system outperformed the baseline, even though it
uses the same feature set.
