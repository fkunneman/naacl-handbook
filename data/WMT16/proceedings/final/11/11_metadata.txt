Abstract#==#Tree-to-tree machine translation (MT) that utilizes syntactic parse trees on
both source and target
sides suffers from the non-isomorphism of the parse trees due to parsing errors
and the difference of
annotation criterion between the two languages. In this paper, we present a
method that projects dependency
parse trees from the language side that has a high quality parser, to the side
that has a low quality parser,
to improve the isomorphism of the parse trees. We first project a part of the
dependencies with high
confidence to make a partial parse tree, and then complement the remaining
dependencies with
partial parsing constrained by the already projected dependencies. MT
experiments verify the
effectiveness of our proposed method.
