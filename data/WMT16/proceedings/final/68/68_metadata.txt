Abstract#==#This paper describes the UU-Hardmeier submissions to the WMT~2016 shared task
on
cross-lingual pronoun prediction. Our model is a system combination of two
different approaches, one based on a neural network with latent anaphora
resolution and the other one on an n-gram model with an additional dependency
on the source pronoun. The combination of the two models results in an
improvement over each individual system, but it appears that the contribution
of
the neural network is more likely due to its context modelling capacities than
to the anaphora resolution subnetwork.
