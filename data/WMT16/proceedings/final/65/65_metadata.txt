Abstract#==#In this paper, we present our new experimental system of merging dependency
representations of two parallel sentences into one dependency tree. All the
inner nodes in dependency tree represent source-target pairs of words, the
extra words are in form of leave nodes. We use Universal Dependencies
annotation style, in which the function words, whose usage often differs
between languages, are annotated as leaves. The parallel treebank is parsed in
minimally supervised way. Unaligned words are there automatically pushed to
leaves. We present a simple translation system trained on such merged trees and
evaluate it in WMT 2016 English-to-Czech and Czech-to-English translation task.
Even though the model is so far very simple and no language model and
word-reordering model were used, the Czech-to-English variant reached similar
BLEU score as another established tree-based system.
