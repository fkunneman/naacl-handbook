Abstract#==#We participated in the Bilingual Document Alignment shared task of WMT 2016
with the intent of testing plain cross-lingual information retrieval platform
built on top of the Apache Lucene framework. We devised a number of interesting
variants, including one that only considers the URLs of the pages, and that
offers --- without any heuristic ---  surprisingly high performances. We
finally submitted the output of a system that combines two informations (TEXT
and URL) from documents and a post-treatment for an accuracy that reaches 92%
on the development dataset distributed for the shared task.
