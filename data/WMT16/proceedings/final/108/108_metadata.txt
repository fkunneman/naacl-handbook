Abstract#==#We describe the English-Turkish and Turkish-English translation systems
submitted by Yandex School of Data Analysis team to WMT16 news translation
task.

We successfully applied hand-crafted morphological (de-)segmentation of
Turkish, syntax-based pre-ordering of English in English-Turkish and
post-ordering of English in Turkish-English. We perform desegmentation using
SMT and propose a
simple yet efficient modification of postordering.

We also show that Turkish morphology and word order can be handled in a
fully-automatic manner with only a small loss of BLEU.
