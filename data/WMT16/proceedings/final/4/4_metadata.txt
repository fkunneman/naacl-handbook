Abstract#==#Character n-gram F-score (chrF) is shown to correlate very well with human
rankings of different machine translation outputs, especially for
morphologically rich target languages. However, only two versions have been
explored so far, namely chrF1 (standard F-score, beta = 1) and chrF3 (beta =
3), both with uniform n-gram weights. 
In this work, we investigated chrF in more details, namely beta parameters in
range from 1/6                    to 6,  and we found out  that chrF2 is the most
promising
version.  
Then we investigated different n-gram weights for chrF2 and found out that the
uniform weights are the best option.
Apart from this, chrF scores were systematically compared with wordF scores,
and a preliminary experiment  carried out on small amount of data with direct
human scores indicates that the main advantage of chrF is that it does not
penalise too hard acceptable variations in high quality translations.
