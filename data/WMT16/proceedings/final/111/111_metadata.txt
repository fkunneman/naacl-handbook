Abstract#==#We present the LIMSI's cross-lingual pronoun prediction system for the WMT 2016
shared task. We use high-level linguistic features with explicit coreference
resolution and expletive detection and rely on dependency annotations and a
morphological lexicon. We show that our few, carefully chosen features perform
significantly better than several language model baselines and competitively
compared to the other systems submitted.
