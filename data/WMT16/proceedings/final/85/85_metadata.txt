Abstract#==#This paper presents the contribution of the Unbabel team to the WMT 2016 Shared
Task on Word-Level Translation Quality Estimation. We describe our two
submitted systems: (i) UNBABEL-LINEAR, a feature-rich sequential linear model
with syntactic features, and (ii) UNBABEL-ENSEMBLE, a stacked combination of
the linear system with three different deep neural networks, mixing
feedforward, convolutional, and recurrent layers. Our systems achieved
F1OK*F1BAD scores of 46.29% and 49.52%, respectively, which were the two
highest scores in the challenge.
