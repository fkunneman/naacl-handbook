Abstract#==#Our participation in Bilingual Document
Alignment shared task at WMT16 focuses
on building a language-independent, scalable
system for aligning documents based
on content as opposed to using webpage
meta information. The resulting system
is capable of producing scored n-best lists
of candidate pages and can therefore be
adapted to tasks where either precision or
recall is maximized. We conduct a series
of experiments that show the effectiveness
of the system without any specific tuning.
