Abstract#==#This paper describes LIMSI’s submissions to the shared WMT’16 task
“Translation of News”. We report results for Romanian-English in both
directions, for English to Russian, as well as preliminary experiments on
reordering to translate from English into German. Our submissions use mainly
NCODE and MOSES along with continuous space models in a post-processing step.
The main novelties of this year’s participation are the following: for the
translation into Russian and Romanian, we have attempted to extend the output
of the decoder with morphological variations and to use a CRF model to rescore
this new search space; as for the translation into German, we have been
experimenting with source-side pre-ordering based on a dependency structure
allowing permutations in order to reproduce the target word order.
