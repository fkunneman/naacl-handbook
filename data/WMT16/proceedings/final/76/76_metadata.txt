Abstract#==#We present a system submitted to the WMT16 shared task in cross-lingual pronoun
prediction, in particular, to the English-to-German and German-to-English
sub-tasks. The system is based on a linear classifier making use of features
both from the target language model and from linguistically analyzed source and
target texts. Furthermore, we apply example weighing in classifier learning,
which proved to be beneficial for recall in less frequent pronoun classes.
Compared to other shared task participants, our best
English-to-German system is able to rank just below the top performing
submissions.
