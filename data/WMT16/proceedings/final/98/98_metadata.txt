Abstract#==#This paper describes our systems for Task 1 of the WMT15 Shared Task on Quality
Estimation. Our submissions use (i) a continuous space language model (CSLM) to
extract sentence embeddings and cross-entropy scores, (ii) a neural network
machine translation (NMT) model, (iii) a set of QuEst features (iv) a
combination of features produced by QuEst and the features produced with CSLM
and NMT. 

Our primary submission achieved third position on official scoring task and
second spot on ranking task. Another interesting finding is the good
performance  obtained only using CSLM sentence embeddings as features  that are
 learned in an unsupervised fashion without any additional hand-crafted
features.
