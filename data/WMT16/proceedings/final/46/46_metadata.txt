Abstract#==#We study the relationship between word order freedom and preordering in
statistical machine translation. To assess word order freedom, we first
introduce a novel entropy measure which quantifies how difficult it is to
predict word order given a source sentence and its syntactic analysis. We then
address preordering for two target languages at the far ends of the word order
freedom spectrum, German and Japanese, and argue that for languages with more
word order freedom, attempting to predict a unique word order given source
clues only is less justified. Subsequently, we examine lattices of n-best word
order predictions as a unified representation for languages from across this
broad spectrum and present an effective solution to a resulting technical
issue, namely how to select a suitable source word order from the lattice
during training. Our experiments show that lattices are crucial for good
empirical performance for languages with freer word order (English–German)
and can provide additional improvements for fixed word order languages
(English–Japanese).
