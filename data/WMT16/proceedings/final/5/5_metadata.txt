Abstract#==#Training discriminative rule selection models is usually expensive because of
the very large size of the hierarchical grammar. Previous approaches reduced
the training costs either by (i) using models that are local to the source side
of the rules or (ii) by heavily pruning out negative samples. Moreover, all
previous evaluations were performed on small scale translation tasks,
containing at most 250,000 sentence pairs. We propose two contributions to
discriminative rule selection. First, we test previous approaches on two
French-English translation tasks in domains for which only limited resources
are available and show that they fail to improve translation quality. To
improve on such tasks, we propose a rule selection model that is (i) global
with rich label-dependent features (ii) trained with all available negative
samples. Our global model yields significant improvements, up to 1 BLEU point,
over previously proposed rule selection models. Second, we successfully scale
rule selection models to large scale translation tasks but have so far failed
to produce significant improvements in BLEU on these tasks.
