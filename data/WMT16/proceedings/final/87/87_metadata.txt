Abstract#==#We describe our submission to the IT-domain translation task of WMT 2016.
We perform domain adaptation with dictionary data on already trained MT systems
with no further retraining. We apply our approach to two conceptually different
systems developed within the QTLeap project: TectoMT and Moses, as well as
Chimera, their combination. In all settings, our method improves the
translation quality. Moreover, the basic variant of our approach is applicable
to any MT system, including a black-box one.
