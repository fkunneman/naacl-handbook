Abstract#==#We present our submission to the cross-lingual pronoun prediction (CLPP) shared
task for English-German and English-French at the First Conference on Machine
Translation (WMT16). We trained a Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) classifier based on
features from Wetzel et al. (2015), that we adapted to the new task and applied
to a new language pair. Additional features such as n-grams of the pronoun
context and prediction of NULL-translations proved helpful to a varying degree.
Experiments with a sequence classifier over pronoun sequences did not show any
improvements. Our submission is among the top three systems for English-French
(61.62% macro-averaged recall) and in the middle range for English-German
(48.72%) out of nine submissions.
