Abstract#==#This paper describes the submission of Johns Hopkins University for the shared
translation task of ACL 2016 First Conference on Machine Translation (WMT
2016). We set up phrase-based, hierarchical phrase-based and syntax-based
systems for all 12 language pairs of this yearâ€™s evaluation campaign. Novel
research directions we investigated include: neural probabilistic language
models, bilingual neural network language models, morphological segmentation,
and the attention-based neural machine translation model as reranking feature.
