Abstract#==#This paper presents an automatic post-editing (APE) method to improve the
translation quality produced by an English--German (EN--DE) statistical machine
translation (SMT) system. Our system is based on Operation Sequential Model
(OSM) combined with phrased-based statistical MT (PB-SMT) system. The system is
trained on monolingual settings between MT outputs ($TL_{MT}$) produced by a
black-box MT system and their corresponding post-edited version ($TL_{PE}$).
Our system achieves considerable improvement over $TL_{MT}$ on a held-out
development set. The reported system achieves 64.10 BLEU (1.99 absolute points
and 3.2% relative improvement in BLEU over raw MT output) and 24.14 TER  and a
TER score of 24.14 (0.66 absolute points and 0.25% relative improvement in TER
over raw MT output) in the official test set.
