Abstract#==#We address the problem of mistranslated predicate-argument structures in
syntax-based machine translation. This paper explores whether knowledge about
semantic affinities between the target predicates and their argument fillers is
useful for translating ambiguous predicates and arguments. We propose a
selectional preference feature based on the selectional association measure of
Resnik96 and integrate it in a string-to-tree decoder. The feature models
selectional preferences of verbs for their core and prepositional arguments as
well as selectional preferences of nouns for their prepositional arguments.  

We compare our features with a variant of the neural relational dependency
language model (RDLM) (Sennrich 2015) and find that neither of the features
improves automatic evaluation metrics. We conclude that mistranslated verbs,
errors in the target syntactic trees produced by the decoder and underspecified
syntactic relations are negatively impacting these features.
