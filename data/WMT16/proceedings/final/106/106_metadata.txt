Abstract#==#This paper describes our submission UFAL_MULTIVEC to the WMT16 Quality
Estimation Shared Task, for English-German sentence-level post-editing effort
prediction and ranking. Our approach exploits the power of  bilingual
distributed representations, word alignments and also manual post-edits to
boost the performance of the baseline QuEst++ set of features. Our model
outperforms the baseline, as well as the winning system in WMT 15, Referential
Translation Machines (RTM), in both scoring and ranking sub-tasks.
