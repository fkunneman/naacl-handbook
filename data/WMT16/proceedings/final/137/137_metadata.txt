Abstract#==#This article presents the DOCAL system
for document alignment, which took part
in the WMT 2016 shared task on bilingual
document alignment. The system is
meant to offer a portable solution for varied
document alignment scenarios, from
parallel to comparable corpora, with minimal
deployment effort. Its main goal is to
provide an optimal balance between alignment
precision and recall using minimal
resources and adaptation across alignment
scenarios. We describe and discuss the
performance of the system in the recalloriented
shared task.
