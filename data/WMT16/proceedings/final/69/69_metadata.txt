Abstract#==#In this paper, we present a novel approach
to combine the two variants of phrase-based
APE (monolingual and context-aware)
by a factored machine translation
model that is able to leverage benefits
from both. Our factored APE models includes
part-of-speech-tag and class-based
neural language models (LM) along with
statistical word-based LM to improve the
fluency of the post-edits. These models
are build upon a data augmentation technique
which helps to mitigate the problem
of over-correction in phrase-based APE
systems. Our primary APE system further
incorporates a quality estimation (QE)
model, which aims to select the best translation
between the MT output and the
automatic post-edit. According to the
shared task results, our primary and contrastive
(which does not include the QE
module) submissions have similar performance
and achieved significant improvement
of 3.31% TER and 4.25% BLEU
(relative) over the baseline MT system on
the English-German evaluation set.
