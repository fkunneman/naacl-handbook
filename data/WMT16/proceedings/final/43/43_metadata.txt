Abstract#==#Neural machine translation (NMT) has emerged recently as a promising 
statistical machine translation approach. In NMT, neural networks (NN) are
directly used to produce translations, without relying on a pre-existing
translation framework. In this work, we take a step towards bridging the gap
between conventional word alignment models and NMT. We follow the hidden Markov
model (HMM) approach that separates the alignment and lexical models. We
propose a neural alignment model and combine it with a lexical neural
model in a log-linear framework. The models are used in a standalone word-based
decoder
that explicitly hypothesizes alignments during search. We demonstrate that our
system outperforms attention-based NMT on two tasks: IWSLT 2013
German-to-English and BOLT Chinese-to-English. We also show promising results
for re-aligning the training data using neural models.
