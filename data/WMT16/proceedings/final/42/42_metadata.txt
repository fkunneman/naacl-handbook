Abstract#==#In this paper we present our approach to the Bilingual Document Alignment Task
(WMT16), where the main
goal was to reach the best recall on extracting aligned pages within the
provided data. 

Our approach consists of tree main parts: data preprocessing, keyword
extraction and text pairs scoring based on keyword matching. 

For text preprocessing we use the TreeTagger pipeline that contains the Unitok
tool for tokenization and the TreeTagger morphological analyzer.

After keywords extraction from the texts according TF-IDF scoring our system
searches for comparable English-French pairs. Using a statistical 
dictionary created from a large English-French parallel corpus, the system is
able to find comaparable documents.

At the end this procedure is combined with the baseline algorithm and best
one-to-one pairing is selected. The result
reaches 91.6% recall on provided training data.

After a deep error analysis the recall reached 97.4%.
