Abstract#==#This paper presents an overview of the system submitted by the University of
Hamburg to the IT domain shared translation task as part of the ACL 2016 First
Conference of Machine Translation (WMT 2016). We have chosen data selection as
a domain adaptation method. The filtering of the general  domain data makes use
of paragraph vectors as a novel approach for scoring the sentences. Experiments
were conducted for English-German under the constrained condition.
