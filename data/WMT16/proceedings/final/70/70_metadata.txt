Abstract#==#We present our systems for the WMT~2016 shared task on cross-lingual
  pronoun prediction. The main contribution is a classifier used to determine
  whether an instance of the ambiguous English pronoun ``it'' functions as
  an anaphoric, pleonastic or event reference pronoun. For the
English-to-French
  task the classifier is
  incorporated in an extended baseline, which takes the form of a source-aware
  language model.
  An implementation of the source-aware language model is also provided for
  each of the remaining language pairs.
