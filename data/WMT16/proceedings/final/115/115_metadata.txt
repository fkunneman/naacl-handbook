Abstract#==#We present a novel neural machine translation (NMT) architecture associating
visual and textual features for translation tasks with multiple modalities.
Transformed global and regional visual features are concatenated with text to
form attend-able sequences which are dissipated over parallel long short-term
memory (LSTM) threads to assist the encoder generating a representation for
attention-based decoding. Experiments show that the proposed NMT outperform the
text-only baseline.
