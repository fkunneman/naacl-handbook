Abstract#==#The cross-lingual pronoun prediction task at WMT 2016 requires to restore the
missing target pronouns  from source text and target lemmatized and POS-tagged
translations.  We propose to use a specific Language Model, which captures the
likelihood of a pronoun given the gender and number of its preceding
(pro)nouns, to select the best candidate in English-to-French subtask. Besides,
we apply some heuristics on pronouns of less dependence on their antecedent's
gender and number, which are specifically based on French and English grammars.
