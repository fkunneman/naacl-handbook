Abstract#==#We explore two approaches to model complement types
(NPs and PPs) in an English-to-German SMT system: A simple
abstract representation inserts pseudo-prepositions that
mark the beginning of noun phrases, to improve the symmetry of
source and target complement types, and to provide a flat
structural information on phrase boundaries. An extension of
this representation generates context-aware synthetic
phrase-table entries conditioned on the source side, to model
complement types in terms of grammatical case and preposition
choice.
Both the simple preposition-informed system 
and the context-aware system significantly
improve over the baseline; 
and the context-aware system is slightly better than the system 
without context information.
