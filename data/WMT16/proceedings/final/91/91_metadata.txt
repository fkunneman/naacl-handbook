Abstract#==#In this paper we describe a method for selecting pairs of parallel documents
(documents that are a translation of each other) from a large collection of
documents obtained from the web.
Our approach is based on a coverage score that reflects the number of distinct
bilingual phrase pairs found in each pair of documents, normalized by the total
number of unique phrases found in them. Since parallel documents tend to share
more bilingual phrase pairs than non-parallel documents, our alignment
algorithm selects pairs of documents with the maximum coverage score from all
possible pairings involving either one of the two documents.
