Abstract#==#We present a simple neural network for word alignment that builds source and
target word window representations to compute alignment scores for sentence
pairs.
To enable unsupervised training, we use an aggregation operation that
summarizes
the alignment scores for a given target word.
A soft-margin objective increases scores for true target words while 
decreasing scores for target words that are not present.
Compared to the popular Fast Align model, our approach improves 
alignment accuracy by 7 AER on English-Czech, by 6 AER on Romanian-English 
and by 1.7 AER on English-French alignment.
