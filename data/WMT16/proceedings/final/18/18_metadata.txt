Abstract#==#German verbal inflection is frequently incorrect in standard statistical
machine translation approaches. German verbs agree with subjects in person and
number, and they bear information about mood and tense. For subject–verb
agreement, we parse German MT output to identify subject–verb pairs and
ensure
that the verb agrees with the subject. We show that this approach improves
subject-verb agreement. We model tense/mood translation from English to German
by means of a statistical classification model. Although our model shows good
results on well-formed data, it does not systematically improve tense and mood.
This is due to many reasons, such as the need for discourse knowledge,
dependency on the domain, and stylistic variety in how tense/mood is
translated. We present a
thorough analysis of these problems.
