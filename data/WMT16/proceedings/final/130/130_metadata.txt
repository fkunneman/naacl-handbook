Abstract#==#We describe the neural machine translation system of New York University (NYU)
and University of Montreal (MILA) for the translation tasks of WMT’16. The
main goal of NYU-MILA submission to WMT’16 is to evaluate a new
character-level decoding approach in neural machine translation on various
language pairs. The proposed neural machine translation system is an
attention-based encoder–decoder with a subword-level en- coder and a
character-level decoder. The decoder of the neural machine translation system
does not require explicit segmentation, when characters are used as to- kens.
The character-level decoding approach provides benefits especially when
translating a source language into other morphologically rich languages.
