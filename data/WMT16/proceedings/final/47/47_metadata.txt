Abstract#==#This work systematically analyzes the smoothing effect of vocabulary reduction
for phrase translation models. We extensively compare various word-level
vocabularies to show that the performance of smoothing is not significantly
affected by the choice of vocabulary. This result provides empirical evidence
that the standard phrase translation model is extremely sparse. Our experiments
also reveal that vocabulary reduction is more effective for smoothing
large-scale phrase tables.
