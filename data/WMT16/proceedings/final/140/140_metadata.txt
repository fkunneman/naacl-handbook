Abstract#==#In this paper, we address the task of automatically aligning/detecting the
bilingual
documents that are translations of each other from a single web-domain as part
of
WMT 2016. 1 Given the large amounts of data available in each web-domain, a
brute force approach like finding similarities between every possible pair is a
computationally
expensive operation. Therefore, we start with a simple approach on matching
just the web page urls after some pre-processing to reduce the number of
possible pairings to a small extent. This simple approach obtained a recall of
50% and the exact matches from this approach
are removed from further consideration. We built on top of this using an n-gram
based approach that uses the partial English translations of French web pages
and achieved a recall of 93.71% on the training pairs provided. We also outline
an IR-based approach that uses both content and the meta data of each web page
url, thereby obtaining a recall of 56.31%. Our
final submission to this shared task using n-gram based approach achieved a
recall of 93.92%.
