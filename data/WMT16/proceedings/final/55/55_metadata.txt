Abstract#==#In this paper we present the system developed at the IXA NLP Group of the
University of the Basque Country for the Biomedical Translation Task in the
First Conference on Machine Translation (WMT16). For the adaptation of a
statistical machine translation system to the biomedical domain, we developed
three approaches based on a baseline system for English-Spanish and
Spanish-English language pairs. The lack of terminology and the variation of
the prominent sense of the words are the issues we have addressed on these
approaches. The best of our systems reached the average of all the systems
submitted in the challenge in most of the evaluation sets.
