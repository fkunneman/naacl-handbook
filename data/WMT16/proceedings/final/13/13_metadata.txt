Abstract#==#Information about the antecedents of pronouns is considered essential to solve
certain translation divergencies of pronouns, such as those concerning the
English "it" when translated into gendered languages, e.g. for French into
"il", "elle", or several other options.  However, none of the machine
translation (MT) systems using anaphora resolution has been able to outperform
a phrase-based statistical MT baseline.  We address here one of the reasons for
this failure: the imperfection of automatic anaphora resolution algorithms.  We
learn from parallel data probabilistic correlations between target-side
pronouns and the gender and number features of their (uncertain) antecedents,
as hypothesized by the Stanford Coreference Resolution system on the source
side.  We embody these correlations into a secondary translation model, which
we invoke upon decoding with the Moses statistical MT system.  This solution
outperforms a deterministic pronoun post-editing system, as well as a
statistical MT baseline, on automatic and human evaluation metrics.
