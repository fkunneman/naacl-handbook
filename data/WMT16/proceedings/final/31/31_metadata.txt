Abstract#==#Large aligned corpora are required for any computer aided translation system to
become effective. In this scenario, bilingual document alignment has gained
utmost importance in recent days. We attempt a simple yet effective approach to
align URLs (Uniform Resource Locator) within two documents in two languages as
a part of WMT2016 Bilingual Document Alignment Shared Task. Our approach
includes the processing of URLs and their embedded texts, which serves as the
main matching criterion. In order to align the text initially, we have used
Gale- Church algorithm, dictionary based translation and Cosine Similarity that
in turn helps us to achieve better results in the alignment task.
