Abstract#==#This paper describes the Universitat d'Alacant submissions (labeled as
UAlacant) to the machine translation quality estimation (MTQE) shared task at
WMT 2016, where we have participated in the word-level and phrase-level MTQE
sub-tasks. Our systems use external sources of bilingual information as a
"black box" to spot sub-segment correspondences between the source segment and
the translation hypothesis. For our submissions, two sources of bilingual
information have been used: machine translation (Lucy LT KWIK Translator and
Google Translate) and the bilingual concordancer Reverso Context. Building upon
the word-level approach implemented for WMT 2015, a method for phrase-based
MTQE is proposed which builds on the probabilities obtained for word-level
MTQE. For each sub-task we have submitted two systems: one using the features
produced exclusively based on on-line sources of bilingual information, and one
combining them with the baseline features provided by the organisers of the
task.
