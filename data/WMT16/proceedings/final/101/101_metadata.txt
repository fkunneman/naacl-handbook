Abstract#==#In this paper we present the results of the University of Sheffield (SHEF)
submissions for the WMT16 shared task on document-level Quality Estimation
(task 3). Our submission explored discourse and document-aware information and
word embeddings as features. SVR and Gaussian Process were used to train the
Quality Estimation models. Results show that discourse features do not improve
over baseline results. On the other hand, the use of word embeddings (combined
with baseline features) and a Gaussian Process model with two kernels led to
the best system of the task (0.391 of Pearson r).
