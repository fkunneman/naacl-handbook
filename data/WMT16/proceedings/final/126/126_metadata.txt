Abstract#==#Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks
(BiRNNs) have shown outstanding results
on sequence-to-sequence learning tasks.
This architecture becomes specially inter-
esting for multimodal machine translation
task, since BiRNNs can deal with images
and text. On most translation systems
the same word embedding is fed to both
BiRNN units. In this paper, we present
several experiments to enhance a base-
line sequence-to-sequence system (Elliott
et al., 2015), for example, by using dou-
ble embeddings. These embeddings are
trained on the forward and backward di-
rection of the input sequence. Our sys-
tem is trained, validated and tested on the
Multi30K dataset (Elliott et al., 2016) in
the context of the WMT 2016 Multimodal
Translation Task. The obtained results
show that the double-embedding approach
performs significantly better than the tra-
ditional single-embedding one.
