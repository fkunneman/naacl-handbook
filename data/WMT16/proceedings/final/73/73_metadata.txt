Abstract#==#This paper describes the recurrent neural network based model for translation
quality estimation. Recurrent neural network based quality estimation model
consists of two parts. The first part using two bidirectional recurrent neural
networks generates the quality information about whether each word in
translation is properly translated. The second part using another recurrent
neural network predicts the final quality of translation. We apply this model
to sentence, word and phrase level of WMT16 Quality Estimation Shared Task. Our
results achieve the excellent performance especially in sentence and
phrase-level QE.
