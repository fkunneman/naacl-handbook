Abstract#==#This paper describes the statistical machine translation system developed at
RWTH Aachen University for the English-to-Romanian translation task of the ACL
2016 First Conference on Machine Translation (WMT 2016).
We combined three different state-of-the-art systems in a system combination: A
phrase-based system, a hierarchical phrase-based system and an attention-based
neural machine translation system. The phrase-based and the hierarchical
phrase-based systems make use of a language model trained on all available
data, a language model trained on the bilingual data and a word class language
model. In addition, we utilized a recurrent neural network language model and a
bidirectional recurrent neural network translation model for reranking the
output of both systems. The attention-based neural machine translation system
was trained using all bilingual data together with the back-translated data
from the News Crawl 2015 corpora.
