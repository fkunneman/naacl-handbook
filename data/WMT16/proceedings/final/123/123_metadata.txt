Abstract#==#We build parallel feature decay algorithms (ParFDA) Moses statistical machine
translation (SMT) systems for English to target translation directions in the
translation task at the first conference on statistical machine
translation~\cite{WMT2016} (WMT16). ParFDA obtains results close to the top
constrained 
phrase-based SMT with an average of 2.99 BLEU points difference using
significantly less computation for building SMT systems than the computation
that would be spent using all available corpora.
