Abstract#==#We present DTED, a submission to the WMT 2016 Metrics Task using structural
information generated by dependency parsing and evaluated using tree edit
distances. In this paper we apply this system to translations produced during
WMT 2015, and compare our scores with human rankings from that year. We find
moderate correlations, despite the human judgements being based on all aspects
of the sentences while our metric is based only on word order.
