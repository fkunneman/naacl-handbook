Abstract#==#We participated in the WMT 2016 shared news translation task by building neural
translation systems for four language pairs, each trained in both directions:
English-Czech, English-German, English-Romanian and English-Russian. Our
systems are based on an attentional encoder-decoder, using BPE subword
segmentation for open-vocabulary translation with a fixed vocabulary. We
experimented with using automatic back-translations of the monolingual News
corpus as additional training data, pervasive dropout, and target-bidirectional
models. All reported methods give substantial improvements, and we see
improvements of 4.3-11.2 BLEU over our baseline systems. In the human
evaluation, our systems were the (tied) best constrained system for 7 out of 8
translation directions in which we participated.
