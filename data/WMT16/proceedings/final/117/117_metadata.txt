Abstract#==#This paper provides an overview of the Sheffield University submission to the
English-Romanian Translation Task of the ACL 2016 First Conference on Machine
Translation (WMT 2016). The submitted translations were produced with a
phrase-based system trained with the Moses decoder. As part of our contribution
to the system combination for the QT21 joint submission, we investigated n-best
rescoring using additional Quality Estimation features. We also experimented
with a weighted ranking optimisation approach derived from the PRO algorithm,
as a secondary submission.
