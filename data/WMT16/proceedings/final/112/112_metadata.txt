Abstract#==#This work describes our submission to the WMT16 Bilingual Document Alignment
task. We show that a very simple distance metric, namely Cosine distance of
tf/idf weighted document vectors provides a quick and reliable way to align
documents. We compare many possible variants for constructing the document
vectors. We also introduce a greedy algorithm that runs quicker and performs
better in practice than the optimal solution to bipartite graph matching. Our
approach shows competitive performance and can be improved even further through
combination with URL based pair matching.
