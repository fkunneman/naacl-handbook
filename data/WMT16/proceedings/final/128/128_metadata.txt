Abstract#==#We describe the statistical machine translation system developed at the
National Research Council of Canada (NRC) for the Russian-English news
translation task of the First Conference on Machine Translation (WMT 2016). Our
submission is a phrase-based SMT system that tackles the morphological
complexity of Russian through comprehensive use of lemmatization. The core of
our lemmatization strategy is to use different views of Russian for different
SMT components: word alignment and bilingual neural network language models use
lemmas, while sparse features and reordering models use fully inflected forms.
Some components, such as the phrase table, use both views of the source.
Russian words that remain out-of-vocabulary (OOV) after lemmatization are
transliterated into English using a statistical model trained on examples mined
from the parallel training corpus. The NRC Russian-English MT system achieved
the highest uncased BLEU and the lowest TER scores among the eight participants
in WMT 2016.
