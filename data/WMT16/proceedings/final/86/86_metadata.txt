Abstract#==#We describe the submissions of USFD team to the phrase-level QE shared task at
the WMT-16. We test two different approaches to phrase-level QE: we enrich the
provided set of baseline features with the information about contexts, and
predict phrase-level scores using predictions of other levels. These approaches
show to perform closely in terms of multiplication of F1-scores (primary
metric), although F1-score for the individual classes differ.
