Abstract#==#The Regesta Imperii (RI) are an important source for research in
European-medieval history. Sources spread over many centuries of medieval
history –mainly charters of German-Roman Emporers – are summarized as
“Regests” and pooled in the RI. Interesting medieval demographic groups and
players are i.a. cities, citizens or spiritual institutions (e.g. bishops or
monasteries). Themes of historical interest are i.a. peace and war or the
endowment of new privileges. We investigate the RI for important players and
themes, applying state-of-the-art text classification methods from
computational linguistics. We examine the performance of different
classification methods in view of the linguistically very heterogeneous RI,
including a Neural Network approach that is designed to capture complex
interactions between players and themes.
