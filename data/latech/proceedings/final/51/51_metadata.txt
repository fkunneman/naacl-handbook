Abstract#==#Policy agenda research is concerned with measuring the policymaker activities.
Topic classification has proven a valuable tool for policy agenda research.
However, manual topic coding is extremely costly and time-consuming. Supervised
topic classification offers a cost-effective and reliable alternative, yet it
introduces new challenges, the most significant of which are the training set
coding, classifier design, and accuracy-efficiency trade-off.  In this work, we
address these challenges in the context of the recently launched Croatian
Policy Agendas project. We describe a new policy agenda dataset, explore the
many system design choices, and report on the insights gained. Our
best-performing model reaches 77% and 68% of F1-score for major topics and
subtopics, respectively.
