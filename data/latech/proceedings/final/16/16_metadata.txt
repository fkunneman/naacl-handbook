Abstract#==#This paper presents a proposal for the normalization of word-forms in
historical texts. To perform this task, we extend on our previous research on
induction of phonology and adapt it to the task of normalization. In
particular, we combine our earlier models with models for learning morphology
(without additional supervision). The results are mixed: induction of the
segmentation of morphemes fails to directly offer significant improvements
while including known morpheme boundaries in standard texts do improve results.
