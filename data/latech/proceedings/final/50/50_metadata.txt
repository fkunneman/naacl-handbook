Abstract#==#This paper investigates whether sentence structure analysis - examining who
appears in subject versus object position - can illuminate who academic
articles portray as having agency in labor relations. We extract subjects and
objects from a corpus of 3,800 academic articles,  and compare both the
relative occurrence of different groups (workers, women, employers) in each
position and the verbs that most commonly attach to each group. We conclude
that agency, while elusive, can potentially be modeled by sentence structure
analysis.
