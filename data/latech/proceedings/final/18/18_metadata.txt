Abstract#==#Despite considerable theoretical work in social sciences, ready to use
resources are very limited compared to digitally available mass media
resources. Thus, this project creates a political protest database from online
news resources in Brazil that will be used to explain Brazilian welfare state
policy changes. In this paper we present the preliminary results of a system
that automatically crawls digital resources and produces a protest database,
which includes events such as strikes, rallies, boycotts, protests, and riots,
as well as their attributes such as location, participants, and ideology.
