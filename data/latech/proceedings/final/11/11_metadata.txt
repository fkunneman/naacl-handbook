Abstract#==#Sarcasm annotation extends beyond linguistic expertise, and often involves
cultural context. This paper presents our first-of-its-kind study that deals
with impact of cultural differences on the quality of sarcasm annotation. For
this study, we consider the case of American text and Indian annotators. For
two sarcasm-labeled datasets of American tweets and discussion forum posts that
have been annotated by American annotators, we obtain annotations from Indian
annotators. Our Indian annotators agree with each other more than their
American counterparts, and face difficulties in case of unfamiliar situations
and named entities.  However, these difficulties in sarcasm annotation result
in statistically insignificant degradation in sarcasm classification.
We also show that these disagreements between annotators can be predicted using
textual properties. Although the current study is limited to two annotators and
one culture pair, our paper opens up a novel direction in evaluation of the
quality of sarcasm annotation, and the impact of this quality on sarcasm
classification.
