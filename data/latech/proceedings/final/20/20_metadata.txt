Abstract#==#Our research aims at tracking the semantic evolution of the lexicon over time.
For this purpose, we investigated two well-known training protocols for neural
language models in a synchronic experiment and encountered several problems
relating to accuracy and reliability. We were able to identify critical
parameters for improving the underlying protocols in order to generate more
adequate diachronic language models.
