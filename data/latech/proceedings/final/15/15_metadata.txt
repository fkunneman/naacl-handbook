Abstract#==#We present results on part-of-speech and morphological tagging for Old Swedish
(1225–1526). In a set of experiments we look at the difference between
within-corpus and across-corpus accuracy, and explore ways of mitigating the
effects of variation and data sparseness by adding different types of
dictionary information. Combining several methods, together with a simple
approach to handle spelling variation, we achieve a major boost in tagger
performance on a modest test collection.
