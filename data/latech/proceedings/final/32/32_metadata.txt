Abstract#==#Progress made in recent years has led to a growing interest in Digital
Heritage. This article focuses on Egyptology and, more specifically, the study
and preservation of ancient Egyptian scripts. We present a Text Retrieval
system developed specifically to work with hieroglyphic texts. We intend to
make it freely available to the research community. To the best of our
knowledge this is the first tool of its kind.
