Abstract#==#Psychological studies have shown that our
state of mind can manifest itself in the
linguistic features we use to communicate.
Recent statistics in suicide prevention
show that young people are increasingly
posting their last words online. In
this paper, we investigate whether it is
possible to automatically identify suicide
notes and discern them from other types of
online discourse based on analysis of sentiments
and linguistic features. Using supervised
learning, we show that our model
achieves an accuracy of 86.6%, outperforming
previous work by over 4%.
