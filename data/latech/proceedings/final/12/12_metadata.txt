Abstract#==#Syntactic change tends to affect constructions, but treebanks annotate
lower-level structure: PCFG rules or dependency arcs. This paper
extends prior work in native language identification, using Tree
Substitution Grammars to discover constructions which can be tested
for historical variability. In a case study comparing Classical and
Medieval Latin, the system discovers several constructions
corresponding to known historical differences, and learns to
distinguish the two varieties with high accuracy. Applied to an
intermediate text (the Vulgate Bible), it indicates which changes
between the eras were already occurring at this earlier stage.
