Abstract#==#This paper describes our contribution to two challenges in data-driven
lemmatization. We approach lemmatization in the framework of a two-stage
process, where first lemma candidates are generated and afterwards a ranker
chooses the most probable lemma from these candidates. The first challenge is
that languages with rich morphology like Modern German can feature
morphological changes of different kinds, in particular word-internal
modification. This makes the generation of the correct lemma a harder task than
just removing suffixes (stemming). The second challenge that we address is
spelling variation as it appears in non-standard texts. We experiment with
different generators that
are specifically tailored to deal with these two challenges. We show in an
oracle
setting that there is a possible increase in lemmatization accuracy of 14% with
our methods to generate lemma candidates on Middle Low German, a group of
historical dialects of German (1200–1650 AD). Using a log-linear model to
choose the correct lemma from the set, we obtain an actual increase of 5.56%.
