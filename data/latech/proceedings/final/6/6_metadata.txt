Abstract#==#Lemlat is a morphological analyser for Latin, which shows a remarkably wide
coverage of the Latin lexicon. However, the performance of the tool is limited
by the absence of proper names in its lexical basis. In this paper we present
the extension of Lemlat with a large Onomasticon for Latin. First, we describe
and motivate the automatic and manual procedures for including the proper names
in Lemlat. Then, we compare the new version of Lemlat with the previous one, by
evaluating their lexical coverage of four Latin texts of different era and
genre.
