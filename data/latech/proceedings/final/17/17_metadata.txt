Abstract#==#We present a new approach for modeling diachronic linguistic change in
grammatical usage. We illustrate the approach on English scientific writing in
Late Modern English, focusing on grammatical patterns that are potentially
indicative of shifts in register, genre and/or style. 
Commonly, diachronic change is characterized by the relative frequency of 
typical linguistic features over time. However, to fully capture changing
linguistic usage, feature productivity needs to be taken into account as well. 
We introduce a data-driven approach for systematically detecting typical
features and assessing their productivity over time, using
information-theoretic measures of entropy and surprisal.
