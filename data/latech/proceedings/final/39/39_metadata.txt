Abstract#==#Social scientists and journalists nowadays have to deal with an increasingly
large amount of data. It usually requires expensive searching and annotation
effort to find insight in a sea of information. Our goal is to build a
discourse analysis system which can be applied to large text collections. This
system can help social scientists and journalists to analyze data and validate
their research theories by providing them with tailored machine learning
methods to alleviate the annotation effort and exploratory facilities and
visualization tools. We report initial experimental results in a case study
related to discourse analysis in political debates.
