Abstract#==#This paper describes ongoing work on a tool developed for annotating document
images for their multimodal features and compiling this information into a
corpus. The tool leverages open source computer vision and natural language
processing libraries to describe the content and structure of multimodal
documents and to generate multiple layers of XML annotation. The paper
introduces the annotation schema, describes the document processing pipeline
and concludes with a brief description of future work.
