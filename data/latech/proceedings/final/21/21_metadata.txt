Abstract#==#This paper provides a description of the automatic conversion of the
morphologically
annotated part of the Old Hungarian Corpus. These texts are in the format of
the Humor analyzer, which does not follow any international standards. Since
standardization always facilitates future research, even for researchers who do
not know the Old Hungarian language, we opted for mapping the Humor formalism
to a widely used universal tagset, namely the Universal Dependencies framework.
The benefits of using a shared tagset across languages enable interlingual
comparisons from a theoretical point of view and also multilingual NLP
applications can profit from a unified annotation scheme. In this paper, we
report the adaptation of the Universal Dependencies morphological annotation
scheme to Old Hungarian, and we discuss the most important theoretical
linguistic issues that had to be resolved during the process. We focus on the
linguistic phenomena typical of Old Hungarian that required special treatment
and we offer solutions to them.
