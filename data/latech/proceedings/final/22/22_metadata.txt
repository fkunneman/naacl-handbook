Abstract#==#In this paper, we describe the development of a language identification system
and a part-of-speech tagger for Latin-Middle English mixed text. To this end,
we annotate data with language IDs and Universal POS tags (Petrov et al.,
2012). As a classifier, we train a conditional random field classifier for both
sub-tasks, including features generated by the TreeTagger models of both
languages. The focus lies on both a general and a task-specific evaluation.
Moreover, we describe our effort concerning beyond proof-of-concept
implementation of tools and towards a more task-oriented approach, showing how
to apply our techniques in the context of Humanities research.
