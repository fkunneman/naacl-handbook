Abstract#==#One of the main interests in the analysis of large document collections is to
discover domains of discourse that are still actively developing, growing in
interest and relevance, at a given point in time, and to distinguish them from
those topics that are in stagnation or decline. The present paper describes a
terminologically inspired approach to this kind of task. The inputs to the
method are a corpus spanning several decades of research in computational
linguistics and a set of single-word terms that frequently occur in that
corpus. The diachronic development of these terms is modelled by means of term
life cycle information, namely the parameters relative frequency and
productivity. In a second step, k-means clustering is used to identify groups
of terms with similar development patterns. The paper describes a mathematical
approach to modelling term productivity and discusses what kind of information
can be obtained from this measure. The results of the clustering experiment are
promising and well motivate future research.
