Abstract#==#The growth of digitization in the cultural heritage domain offers great
possibilities to broaden the boundaries of historical research. With the
ultimate aim of creating social networks of person names from news articles, we
introduce a person name disambiguation method that exploits the relation
between the ambiguity of a person name and the number of entities referred to
by it. Modeled as a clustering problem with a strong focus on social relations,
our system dynamically adapts its clustering strategy to the most suitable
configuration for each name depending on how common this name is. Our
method’s performance is on par with the state-of-the-art reported for the
CRIPCO dataset, while using less specific resources.
