Abstract#==#Measuring the semantic relatedness of phrase pairs is important for evaluating
compositional distributional semantic representations. Many existing phrase
relatedness datasets are limited to either lexical or syntactic alternations
between phrase pairs, which limits the power of the evaluation. We propose
SLEDDED (Syntactically and LExically Divergent Dataset of Event Descriptions),
a dataset of event descriptions in which related phrase pairs are designed to
exhibit minimal lexical and syntactic overlap; for example, 'a decisive
victory' -- 'won the match clearly'. We also propose a subset of the data aimed
at distinguishing event descriptions from related but dissimilar phrases; for
example, 'vowing to fight to the death' -- 'a new training regime for
soldiers', which serves as a proxy for the tasks of narrative generation, event
sequencing, and summarization. We describe a method for extracting candidate
pairs from a corpus based on occurrences of event nouns (e.g. 'war') and a
two-step annotation process consisting of expert annotation followed by
crowdsourcing. We present examples from a pilot of the expert annotation step.
