Abstract#==#This paper presents an analysis of existing methods for the intrinsic
evaluation of word embeddings. We show that the main methodological premise of
such evaluations is ``interpretability" of word embeddings: a ``good" embedding
produces results that make sense in terms of traditional linguistic categories.
This approach is not only of limited practical use, but also fails to do
justice to the strengths of distributional meaning representations. We argue
for a shift from abstract ratings of word embedding ``quality" to exploration
of their strengths and weaknesses.
