Abstract#==#Word embedding vectors are used as input for a variety of tasks. Choosing the
right model and features for producing such vectors is not a trivial task and
different embedding methods can greatly affect results. In this paper we
repurpose the "Pyramid Method" annotations used for evaluating automatic
summarization to create a benchmark for comparing embedding models when
identifying paraphrases of text snippets containing a single clause. We present
a method of converting pyramid annotation files into two distinct sentence
embedding tests. We show that our method can produce a good amount of testing
data, analyze the quality of the testing data, perform test on several leading
embedding methods, and finally explain the downstream usages of our task and
its significance.
