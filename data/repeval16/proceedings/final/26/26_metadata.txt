Abstract#==#The quality of word representations is frequently assessed using correlation
with human judgements of word similarity. Here, we question whether such
intrinsic evaluation can predict the merits of the representations for
downstream tasks. We study the correlation between results on ten word
similarity benchmarks and tagger performance on three standard sequence
labeling tasks using a variety of word vectors induced from an unannotated
corpus of 3.8 billion words, and demonstrate that most intrinsic evaluations
are poor predictors of downstream performance. We argue that this issue can be
traced in part to a failure to distinguish specific similarity from relatedness
in intrinsic evaluation datasets. We make our evaluation tools openly available
to facilitate further study.
