Abstract#==#If lexical similarity can hardly be used reliably to assess how word vectors
will perform on specific tasks, what other ways do we have of evaluating
representations? We propose a new task, which consists in extracting semantic
differences using distributional models: given two words, what is the
difference between their meanings? We present two proof of concept datasets for
this task and outline how it may be performed.
