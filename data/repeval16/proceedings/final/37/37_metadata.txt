Abstract#==#The main intrinsic evaluation for vector space representation has been focused
on textual similarity, where the task is to predict how semantically similar
two words or sentences are. We propose a novel framework, Story Cloze
Evaluator, for evaluating vector representations which goes beyond textual
similarity and captures the notion of predicting what should happen next given
a context. This evaluation methodology is simple to run, scalable, reproducible
by the community, non-subjective and 100% agreeable by human, which makes it a
promising new framework for further investment of the representation learning
community.
