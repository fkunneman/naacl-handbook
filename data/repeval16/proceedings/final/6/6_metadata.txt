Abstract#==#The workshop CfP assumes that down-stream evaluation of word embeddings is
impractical, and that a valid evaluation metric for pairs of word embeddings
can be found. I argue below that if so, the only meaningful evaluation
procedure is comparison with measures of human word processing in the wild.
Such evaluation is non-trivial, but I present a practical procedure here,
evaluating word embeddings as features in a multi-dimensional regression model
predicting brain imaging or eye-tracking word-level aggregate statistics.
