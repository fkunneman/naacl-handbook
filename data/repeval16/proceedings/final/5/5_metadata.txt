Abstract#==#We present a new framework for an intrinsic evaluation of word vector
representations based on the outlier detection task. This task is intended to
test the capability of vector space models to create semantic clusters in the
space. We carried out a pilot study building a gold standard dataset and the
results revealed two important features: human performance on the task is
extremely high compared to the standard word similarity task, and
state-of-the-art word embedding models, whose current shortcomings were
highlighted as part of the evaluation, still have considerable room for
improvement.
