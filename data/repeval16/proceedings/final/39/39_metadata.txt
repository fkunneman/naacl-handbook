Abstract#==#The way humans define words is a powerful way of representing them.  In this
work, we propose to measure word similarity by comparing the overlap in their
definition.  This highlights linguistic phenomena that are complementary to the
information extracted from standard context-based representation learning
techniques.  To acquire a large amount of word definitions in a cost-efficient
manner, we designed a simple interactive word game, Word Sheriff.  As a
byproduct of game play, it generates short word sequences that can be used to
uniquely identify words.  These sequences can not only be used to evaluate the
quality of word representations, but it could ultimately give an alternative
way of learning them, as it overcomes some of the limitations of the
distributional hypothesis.  Moreover, inspecting player behaviour reveals
interesting aspects about human strategies and knowledge acquisition beyond
those of simple word association games, due to the conversational nature of the
game.  Lastly, we outline a vision of a communicative evaluation setting, where
systems are evaluated based on how well a given representation allows a system
to communicate with human and computer players.
