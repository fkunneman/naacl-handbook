Abstract#==#Most evaluations for vector space models are semantically motivated,
e.g. by measuring how well they capture word similarity.  If one is
interested in syntax-related downstream applications such as
parsing, a syntactically motivated evaluation seems preferable.  As we show,
the choice of embeddings has a noticeable impact on parser
performance.  Since evaluating embeddings directly in a parser is
costly, we analyze the correlation between the full parsing task and a simple
linear
classification task as a potential proxy.
