Abstract#==#Lacking standardized extrinsic evaluation methods for vector
representations of words, the NLP community has relied heavily on word
similarity tasks as a proxy for intrinsic evaluation of word vectors.
Word similarity evaluation, which correlates the distance between vectors and
human judgments of ``semantic similarity'' is attractive, because it is
computationally inexpensive and fast.  In this paper we present several
problems associated with the evaluation of word vectors on word similarity
datasets, and summarize existing solutions. Our study suggests that the use of
word similarity tasks for evaluation of word vectors is not sustainable and
calls for further research on evaluation methods.
