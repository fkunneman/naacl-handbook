Abstract#==#We suggest a new method for creating and
using gold-standard datasets for word similarity
evaluation. Our goal is to improve
the reliability of the evaluation, and we do
this by redesigning the annotation task to
achieve higher inter-rater agreement, and
by defining a performance measure which
takes the reliability of each annotation decision
in the dataset into account.
