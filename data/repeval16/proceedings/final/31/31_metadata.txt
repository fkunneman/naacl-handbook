Abstract#==#While there has been a growing body of work on word embeddings, and recent
directions better reflect sense-level representations, evaluation remains a
challenge. We propose a method of query inventory generation for embedding
evaluation that recasts the principle of subsumption preservation, a desirable
property of semantic graph-based similarity measures, as a comparative
similarity measure as applied to existing lexical resources. We aim that this
method is immediately applied to populate query inventories and perform
evaluation with the ordered triple-based approach set forth, and inspires
future refinements to existing notions of evaluating sense-directed embeddings.
