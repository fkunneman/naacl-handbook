Abstract#==#In this proposal track paper, we have proposed a crowdsourcing based word
embedding evaluation technique that will be reliable (unambiguous) and
linguistically justified. The method is designed for intrinsic evaluation and
is inspired by the proposed method in (Schnabel et al.,2015). We have
recognised a methodological shortcoming of the approach provided in that paper,
and proposed an improved evaluation techniques that will capture better word
relatedness based on context.
