Abstract#==#Vector space models of word representation are often evaluated using human
similarity ratings. Those ratings are elicited in explicit tasks and have
well-known subjective biases. As an alternative, we propose evaluating vector
spaces using implicit cognitive measures. We focus in particular on semantic
priming, exploring the strengths and limitations of existing datasets, and
propose ways in which those datasets can be improved.
