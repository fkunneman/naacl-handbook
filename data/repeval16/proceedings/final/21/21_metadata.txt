Abstract#==#Recently, researchers in speech recognition have started to reconsider using
whole words as the basic modeling unit, instead of phonetic units. These
systems rely on a function that embeds an arbitrary or fixed dimensional speech
segments to a vector in a fixed-dimensional space, named acoustic word
embedding. Thus, speech segments of words that sound similarly will be
projected in a close area in a continuous space. This paper focuses on the
evaluation of acoustic word embeddings. We propose two approaches to evaluate
the intrinsic performances of acoustic word embeddings in comparison to
orthographic representations in order to evaluate whether they capture
discriminative phonetic information. Since French language is targeted in
experiments, a particular focus is made on homophone words.
