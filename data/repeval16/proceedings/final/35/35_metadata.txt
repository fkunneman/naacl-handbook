Abstract#==#In this paper, we discuss the human thematic fit judgement                     
correlation task in the context of real-valued vector space word
representations. Thematic fit is the extent to which an argument
fulfils the selectional preference of a verb given a role: for
example, how well "cake" fulfils the patient role of "cut".  In
recent work, systems have been evaluated on this task by finding the
correlations of their output judgements with human-collected judgement
data.  This task is a representation-independent way of evaluating
models that can be applied whenever a system score can be generated,
and it is applicable wherever predicate-argument relations are
significant to performance in end-user tasks. Significant progress has
been made on this cognitive modeling task, leaving considerable space
for future, more comprehensive types of evaluation.
