Abstract#==#This paper aims to re-think the role of the word similarity task in
distributional semantics research. We argue while it is a valuable tool, it
should be used with care because it provides only an approximate measure of the
quality of a distributional model. Word similarity evaluations assume there
exists a single notion of similarity that is independent of a particular
application. Further, the small size and low inter-annotator agreement of
existing data sets makes it challenging to find significant differences between
models.
