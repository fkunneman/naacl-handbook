Abstract#==#We propose a diagnostic method for probing specific information captured in
vector representations of sentence meaning, via simple classification tasks
with strategically constructed sentence sets. We identify some key types of
semantic information that we might expect to be captured in sentence
composition, and illustrate example classification tasks for targeting this
information.
