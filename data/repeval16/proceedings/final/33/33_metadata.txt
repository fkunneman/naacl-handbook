Abstract#==#Existing corpora for intrinsic evaluation are not targeted towards tasks in
informal domains such as Twitter or news comment forums. We want to test
whether a representation of informal words fulfills the promise of eliding
explicit text normalization as a preprocessing step. One possible
evaluation metric for such domains is the proximity of spelling variants. We
propose how such a metric might be computed and how a spelling variant dataset
can be collected using UrbanDictionary.
