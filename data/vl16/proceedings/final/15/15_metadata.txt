Abstract#==#Current evaluation metrics for image description may be
 too coarse. We therefore propose a series of binary forced-choice tasks that
each focus on a different
 aspect of the captions. We evaluate a number of different off-the-shelf image
description systems.
Our results indicate  strengths and shortcomings of both generation and ranking
based approaches.
