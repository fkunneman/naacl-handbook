Abstract#==#Differential diagnosis aims at distinguishing between diseases causing similar
symptoms. This is exemplified by epilepsies and dissociative disorders.
Recently, it has been shown that linguistic features of physician-patient talks
allow for differentiating between these two diseases. Since this method relies
on trained linguists, it is not suitable for daily use. In this paper, we
introduce a novel approach, called text2voronoi, for utilizing the paradigm of
text visualization to reconstruct differential diagnosis as a task of text
categorization. In line with current research on linguistic differential
diagnosis, we explore linguistic characteristics of physician-patient talks to
span our feature space. However, unlike standard approaches to categorization,
we do not use linguistic feature spaces directly, but explore visual features
derived from the talks’ pictorial representations. That is, we provide an
approach to image-driven differential diagnosis. By example of 24 talks of
epileptics and dissociatively disordered patients, we show that our approach
outperforms its counterpart based on the bag-of-words model.
