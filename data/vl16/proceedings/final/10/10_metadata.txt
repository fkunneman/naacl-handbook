Abstract#==#This preliminary study investigates whether, and to what extent, conceptual
combination is conveyed by vision. Working with noun-noun compounds we show
that, for some cases, the composed visual vector built with a simple additive
model is effective in approximating the visual vector representing the complex
concept.
