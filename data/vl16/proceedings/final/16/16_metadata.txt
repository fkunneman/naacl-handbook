Abstract#==#Detecting discriminative semantic attributes from text which correlate with
image features is one of the main challenges of zero-shot learning for
fine-grained image classification. Particularly, using full-length encyclopedic
articles as textual descriptions has had
limited success, one reason being that such documents contain many non-visual
or unrelated sentences. We propose a method to automatically extract visually
relevant sentences from Wikipedia documents. Our model, based on a
convolutional neural network, is robustly tested through ground truth labeling
obtained via Amazon Mechanical Turk, achieving %83.40\% precision, 80.13\%
recall, and 81.73\% F1 measure.
