Abstract#==#We present a multi-modal dialogue system for interactive learning of
perceptually grounded word meanings from a human tutor. The system integrates
an incremental, semantic parsing/generation framework - Dynamic Syntax and Type
Theory with Records (DS-TTR) - with a set of visual classifiers that are
learned throughout the interaction and which ground the meaning representations
that it produces. We use this system in interaction with a simulated human
tutor to study the effect of different dialogue policies and capabilities on
accuracy of learned meanings, learning rates, and efforts/costs to the tutor.
We show that the overall performance of the learning agent is affected by (1)
who takes initiative in the dialogues; (2) the ability to express/use their
confidence level about visual attributes; and (3) the ability to process
elliptical as well as incrementally constructed dialogue turns.
