Abstract#==#There has been continuous growth in the volume and ubiquity of video material.
It has become essential to define video semantics in order to aid the
searchability and retrieval of this data. Although the method of annotating
this data with keywords is relatively well researched, the quality can be
improved through describing videos with natural language. We are exploring
approaches to generating natural language descriptions of interrelations
between human activities in a video stream. This paper focuses on creation of a
dataset that can be used for development and evaluation. To this end a corpus
of video clips, manually selected from the Hollywood2 dataset, and their
natural language descriptions has been generated. Analysis of the hand
annotation presents insights into human interests and thoughts. Such resource
can be used to evaluate automatic natural language generation systems for
video.
