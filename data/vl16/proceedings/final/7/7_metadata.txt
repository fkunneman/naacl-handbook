Abstract#==#Explicit representations of images are useful for linguistic applications
related to imaages. We design a representation based on first-order models that
capture the objects present in an image as well as their spatial relations. 
We take a supervised learning approach to the spatial relation classification
problem and study the effects of spatial and lexical information on prediction
performance. We find that lexical information is required to accurately predict
spatial relations when combined with location information, achieving an F-score
of 0.80 (compared to a most-frequent-class baseline of 0.62).
