Abstract#==#We provide a qualitative analysis of the descriptions containing negations
(\emph{no}, \emph{not}, \emph{n't}, \emph{nobody}, etc) in the Flickr30K
corpus, and a categorization of negation uses. Based on this analysis, we
provide a set of requirements that an image description system should have in
order to generate negation sentences. As a pilot experiment, we used our
categorization to manually annotate sentences containing negations in the
Flickr30k corpus, with an agreement score of $\kappa$=0.67. With this paper, we
hope to open up a broader discussion of subjective language in image
descriptions.
