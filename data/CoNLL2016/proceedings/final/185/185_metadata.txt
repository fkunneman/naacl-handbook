Abstract#==#We present methods for investigating processes of evolution in a language
family by modeling relationships among the observed languages.                       
     

  The
models aim
to find regularities---regular correspondences in lexical data.  We present an
algorithm which codes the data using phonetic features of sounds, and learns
long-range contextual rules that condition recurrent sound correspondences
between languages.  This gives us a measure of model quality: better models
find more regularity in the data. We also present a procedure for imputing
unseen data, which provides another method of model comparison.  Our
experiments demonstrate improvements in performance compared to prior work.
