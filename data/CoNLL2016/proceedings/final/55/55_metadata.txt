Abstract#==#Verb prediction is important in human sentence processing and, practically, in
simultaneous machine translation. In verb-final languages, speakers select the
final verb before it is uttered, and listeners predict it before it is uttered.
Simultaneous interpreters must do the same to translate in real-time. Motivated
by the problem of SOV-SVO simultaneous machine translation, we provide a study
of incremental verb prediction in verb-final languages. As a basis of
comparison, we examine incremental verb prediction with human participants in a
multiple choice setting using crowdsourcing to gain insight into incremental
human performance in a constrained setting. We then examine a computational
approach to incremental verb prediction using discriminative classification
with shallow features. Both humans and machines predict verbs more accurately
as more of a sentence is available, and case markers—when available—help
humans and
sometimes machines predict final verbs.
