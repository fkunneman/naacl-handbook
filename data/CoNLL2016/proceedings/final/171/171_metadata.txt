Abstract#==#In this work, we explore how learners can infer second-language noun meanings
in the context of their native language. Motivated by an interest in building
interactive tools for language learning, we collect data on three word-guessing
tasks, analyze their difficulty, and explore the types of errors that novice
learners make. We train a log-linear model for predicting our subjects' guesses
of word meanings in varying kinds of contexts. The model's predictions
correlate well with subject performance, and we provide quantitative and
qualitative analyses of both human and model performance.
