Abstract#==#In this work, we propose a semi-supervised method for short text clustering,
where we represent texts as distributed vectors with neural networks, 
and use a small amount of labeled data to specify our intention for clustering.
We design a novel objective to combine the representation learning process and
the k-means clustering process together, 
and optimize the objective with both labeled data and unlabeled data
iteratively until convergence through three steps: 
(1) assign each short text to its nearest centroid based on its representation
from the current neural networks; 
(2) re-estimate the cluster centroids based on cluster assignments from step
(1); 
(3) update neural networks according to the objective by keeping centroids and
cluster assignments fixed. 
Experimental results on four datasets show that our method works significantly
better than several other text clustering methods.
