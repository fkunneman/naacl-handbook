Abstract#==#This paper studies how word embeddings trained on the British National Corpus
interact with part of speech boundaries. Our work targets the Universal PoS tag
set, which is currently actively being used for annotation of a range of
languages. We experiment with training classifiers for predicting PoS tags for
words based on their embeddings. The results show that the information about
PoS affiliation contained in the distributional vectors allows us to discover
groups of words with distributional patterns that differ from other words of
the same part of speech. 

This data often reveals hidden inconsistencies of the annotation process or
guidelines. At the same time, it supports the notion of `soft' or `graded' part
of speech affiliations. Finally, we show that information about PoS is
distributed among dozens of vector components, not limited to only one or two
features.
