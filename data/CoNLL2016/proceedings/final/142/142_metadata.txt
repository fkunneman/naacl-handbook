Abstract#==#Machine Translation Quality Estimation is a notoriously difficult task, which
lessens its usefulness in real-world translation environments. Such scenarios
can be improved if quality predictions are accompanied by a measure of
uncertainty. However, models in this task are traditionally evaluated only in
terms of point estimate metrics, which do not take prediction uncertainty into
account. We investigate probabilistic methods for Quality Estimation that can
provide well-calibrated uncertainty estimates and evaluate them in terms of
their full posterior predictive distributions. We also show how this posterior
information can be useful in an asymmetric risk scenario, which aims to capture
typical situations in translation workflows.
