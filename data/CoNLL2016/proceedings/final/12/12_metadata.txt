Abstract#==#Cross lingual projection of linguistic annotation suffers from many sources of
bias and noise, leading to unreliable annotations that cannot be used directly.
In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to sequence tagging that learns to
correct the errors from cross-lingual projection using an explicit debiasing
layer. This is framed as joint learning over two corpora, one tagged with gold
standard and the other with projected tags. We evaluated with only 1,000 tokens
tagged with gold standard tags, along with more plentiful parallel data. Our
system equals or exceeds the state-of-the-art on eight simulated low-resource
settings, as well as two real low-resource languages, Malagasy and Kinyarwanda.
