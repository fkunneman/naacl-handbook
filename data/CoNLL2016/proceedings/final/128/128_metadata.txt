Abstract#==#Discourse relations can either be implicit
or explicitly expressed by markers, such
as ’therefore’ and ’but’. How a speaker
makes this choice is a question that is
not well understood. We propose a psycholinguistic
model that predicts whether
a speaker will produce an explicit marker
given the discourse relation s/he wishes to
express. Based on the framework of the
Rational Speech Acts model, we quantify
the utility of producing a marker based
on the information-theoretic measure of
surprisal, the cost of production, and a
bias to maintain uniform information density
throughout the utterance. Experiments
based on the Penn Discourse Treebank
show that our approach outperforms state-of-
the-art approaches, while giving an explanatory
account of the speaker’s choice.
