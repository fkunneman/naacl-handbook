Abstract#==#Current automatic machine translation systems require heavy human proof-reading
to produce high-quality translations. We present a new interactive machine
translation approach aimed at providing a natural collaboration between humans
and translation systems. As such, we grant the user complete freedom to
validate and correct any part of the translations suggested by the system. Our
approach is then designed according to the requirements placed by this
unrestricted proof-reading protocol. In particular, the ability of the system
to suggest new translations coherent with the set of potentially disjoint
translation segments validated by the user.

We evaluate our approach in a user-simulated setting where reference
translations are considered the output desired by a human expert. Results show
important reductions in the number of edits in comparison to decoupled
post-editing and conventional prefix-based interactive translation prediction.
Additionally, we provide evidence that it can also reduce the cognitive
overload reported for interactive translation systems in previous user studies.
