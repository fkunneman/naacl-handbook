Abstract#==#We present a transition-based parser that jointly produces syntactic and
semantic dependencies. It learns a representation of the entire algorithm
state, using stack long short-term memories. Our greedy inference algorithm has
linear time, including feature extraction. On the CoNLL 2008--9 English shared
tasks, we obtain the best published parsing performance among models that
jointly learn syntax and semantics.
