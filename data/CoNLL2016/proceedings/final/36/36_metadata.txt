Abstract#==#We propose an unsupervised approach for substring-based transliteration which
incorporates two new sources of knowledge in the learning process: (i) context
by learning substring mappings, as opposed to single character mappings, and
(ii) phonetic features which capture cross-lingual character similarity via
prior distributions. 

Our approach is a two-stage iterative, boot-strapping solution, which vastly
outperforms Ravi and Knight (2009)'s state-of-the-art unsupervised
transliteration method and outperforms a rule-based baseline by up to 50% for
top-1 accuracy on multiple language pairs. We show that substring-based models
are superior to character-based models, and observe that their top-10 accuracy
is comparable to the top-1 accuracy of supervised systems. 

Our method only requires a phonemic representation of the words. This is
possible for many language-script combinations which have a high
grapheme-to-phoneme correspondence e.g. scripts of Indian languages derived
from the Brahmi script. Hence, Indian languages were the focus of our
experiments. For other languages, a grapheme-to-phoneme converter would be
required.
