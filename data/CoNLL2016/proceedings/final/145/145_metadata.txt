Abstract#==#Domain-independent meaning representation of text has received a renewed
interest in the NLP community. Comparison plays a crucial role in shaping
objective and subjective opinion and measurement in natural language, and is
often expressed in complex constructions including ellipsis. In this paper we
introduce a novel framework for jointly capturing the semantic structure of
comparison and ellipsis constructions. Our framework models ellipsis and
comparison as inter-connected predicate-argument structures, which enables
automatic ellipsis resolution. We show that a structured prediction model
trained on our dataset of 2,800 gold annotated review sentences yields
promising results. Together with this paper we release the dataset and an
annotation tool which enables two-stage expert annotation on top of tree
structures.
