Abstract#==#For most entity disambiguation systems, the secret recipes are feature
representations for mentions and entities, most of which are handcrafted
Bag-of-Words (BoW) representations. BoW has several drawbacks: (1) It ignores
the intrinsic meaning of words/entities; (2) It often results in high-dimension
vector spaces and expensive computation; (3) Handcrafting representations often
requires extensive experimental trials, lacking of a general guideline to
guarantee its quality. In this paper, we propose a different approach named
EDKate. We first learn low-dimensional continuous vector representations for
entities and words by jointly embedding knowledge bases and text in the same
vector space. Then we utilize these embeddings to design simple but effective
features and build a two-layer disambiguation model. Extensive experiments on
real-word data sets show that (1) The embedding-based features are very
effective. Even a single one embedding-based feature can beat the combination
of several BoW-based features. (2) The superiority is even more promising in a
difficult set where the mention-to-entity prior cannot work well. (3) The
proposed embedding method is much better than trivial implementations of some
off-the-shelf embedding algorithms. (4) We compared our EDKate with existing
methods/systems and the results are also positive.
