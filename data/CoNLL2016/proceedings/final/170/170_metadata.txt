Abstract#==#Most automatic text summarization systems proposed to date rely on centrality
and structural features as indicators for information importance. In this
paper, we argue that these features cannot reliably detect important
information in heterogeneous document collections. Instead, we propose CPSum, a
summarizer that learns the importance of information objects from a background
source. Our hypothesis is tested on multi-document corpora with removed
centrality and structural features. CPSum shows to be able to perform well in
these corpora whereas reference systems fail.
