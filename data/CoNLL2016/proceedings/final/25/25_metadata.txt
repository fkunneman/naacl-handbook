Abstract#==#The ability to capture time information is essential to many natural language
processing and information retrieval applications. Therefore, a lexical
resource associating word senses to their temporal orientation might be crucial
for the computational tasks aiming at the interpretation of language of time in
texts. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised minimum cuts strategy that
makes use of WordNet glosses and semantic relations to supplement WordNet
entries with temporal information. Intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations show
that our approach outperforms prior semi-supervised non-graph classifiers.
