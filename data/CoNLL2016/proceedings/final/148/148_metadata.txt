Abstract#==#Semantic scripts is a conceptual representation which defines how events are
organized into higher level activities. Practically all the previous approaches
to inducing script knowledge from text relied on count-based techniques (e.g.,
generative models) and have not attempted to compositionally model events. In
this work, we introduce a neural network model which relies on distributed
compositional representations of events. The model captures statistical
dependencies between events in a scenario, overcomes some of the shortcomings
of previous approaches (e.g., by more effectively dealing with data sparsity)
and outperforms count-based counterparts on the narrative cloze task.
