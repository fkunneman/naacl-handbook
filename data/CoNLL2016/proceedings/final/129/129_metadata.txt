Abstract#==#In this paper, we propose a method which uses semi-supervised convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) to select in-domain training data for statistical
machine translation. This approach is particularly effective when only tiny
amounts of in-domain data are available. The in-domain data and randomly
sampled general-domain data are used to train a data selection model with
semi-supervised CNN, then this model computes domain relevance scores for all
the sentences in the general-domain data set. The sentence pairs with top
scores are selected to train the system. We carry out experiments on 4 language
directions with three test domains. Compared with strong baseline systems
trained with large amount of data,   this method can improve the performance up
to 3.1 BLEU.  Its performances are significant better than three
state-of-the-art language model based data selection methods. We also show that
the in-domain data used to train the selection model could be as few as 100
sentences, which makes fine-grained topic-dependent translation adaptation
possible.
