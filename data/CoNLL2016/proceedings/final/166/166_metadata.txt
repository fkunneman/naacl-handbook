Abstract#==#Named Entity Recognition (NER) models for language L are typically trained
using annotated data in that language. We study cross-lingual NER, where a
model for NER in L is trained on another, source, language (or multiple source
languages). 
We introduce a language independent method for NER, building on cross-lingual
wikification, a technique that grounds words and phrases in non-English text
into English Wikipedia entries. Thus, mentions in any language can be described
using a set of categories and FreeBase types, yielding, as we show, strong
language-independent features. 
With this insight, we propose an NER model that can be applied to all languages
in Wikipedia.                        When trained on English, our model outperforms
comparable
approaches on the standard CoNLL datasets (Spanish, German, and Dutch) and also
performs very well on low-resource languages (e.g., Turkish, Tagalog, Yoruba,
Bengali, and Tamil) that have significantly smaller Wikipedia. Moreover, our
method allows us to train on multiple source languages, typically  improving
NER results on the target languages. Finally, we show that our
language-independent features can be used also to enhance monolingual NER
systems, yielding improved results for all 9 languages.
