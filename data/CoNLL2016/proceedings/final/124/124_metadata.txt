Abstract#==#Sentiments expressed in user-generated short text and sentences are nuanced by
subtleties at lexical, syntactic, semantic and pragmatic levels. To address
this, we propose to augment traditional features used for sentiment analysis
and sarcasm detection, with cognitive features derived from the eye-movement
patterns of readers.Statistical classification using our enhanced feature set
improves the performance (F-score) of polarity detection by a maximum of 3.7%
and 9.3% on two datasets, over the systems that use only traditional features.

We perform feature significance analysis, and experiment on a held-out dataset,
showing that cognitive features indeed empower sentiment analyzers to handle
complex constructs.
