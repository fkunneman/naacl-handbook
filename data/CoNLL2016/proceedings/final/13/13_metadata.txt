Abstract#==#Coreference resolution for event mentions enables extraction systems to process
document-level information. Current systems in this area base their decisions
on rich semantic features from various knowledge bases, thus restricting them
to domains where such external sources are available. We propose a model for
this task which does not rely on such features but instead utilizes sentential
features coming from convolutional neural networks. Two such networks first
process coreference candidates and their respective context, thereby generating
latent-feature representations which are tuned towards event aspects relevant
for a linking decision. These representations are augmented with lexical-level
and pairwise features, and serve as input to a trainable similarity function
producing a coreference score. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance
on two datasets, one of which is publicly available. An error analysis points
out directions for further research.
