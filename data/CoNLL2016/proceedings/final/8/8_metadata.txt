Abstract#==#This paper is a novel study that views sarcasm detection in dialogue as a
sequence labeling task, where a dialogue is made up of a sequence of
utterances. We create a manually-labeled dataset of
dialogue from TV series `Friends' annotated with sarcasm. Our goal is to
predict sarcasm in each utterance, using sequential nature of a scene. We show
performance gain using sequence labeling as compared to
classification-based approaches. 

Our experiments are based on three sets of features, one is derived from
information in our dataset, the other
two are from past works. Two sequence labeling algorithms (SVM-HMM and SEARN)
outperform three classification algorithms (SVM, Naive Bayes) for all these
feature sets, with an increase in F-score of around 4\%. Our
observations highlight the viability of sequence labeling techniques for
sarcasm detection of dialogue.
