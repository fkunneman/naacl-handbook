Abstract#==#We study the automatic detection of suggestion expressing text among the
opinionated text. The examples of such suggestions in online reviews would be,
customer suggestions about improvement in a commercial entity, and advice to
the fellow customers. We present a qualitative and quantitative analysis of
suggestions present in the text samples obtained from social media platforms.
Suggestion mining from social media is an emerging research area, and thus
problem definition and datasets are still evolving; this work also contributes
towards the same. The problem has been formulated as a sentence classification
task, and we compare the results of some popular supervised learning approaches
in this direction. We also evaluate different kinds of features with these
classifiers. The experiments indicate that deep learning based approaches tend
to be promising for this task.
