Abstract#==#In this paper, we propose methods to take into account the disagreement between
crowd annotators as well as their skills for weighting instances in learning
algorithms.
The latter can thus better deal with noise in the annotation and produce higher
accuracy. We created two passage reranking datasets: one with crowdsource
platform,
and the second with an expert who completely revised the crowd annotation.
Our experiments show that our weighting approach reduces noise improving
passage
reranking up to 1.47% and 1.85% on MRR and P@1, respectively.
