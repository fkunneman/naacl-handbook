Abstract#==#One may express favor (or disfavor)
towards a target by using  positive or negative language.
Here for the first time we present a dataset of tweets annotated for whether
the tweeter
is in favor of or against pre-chosen targets, as well as for sentiment. These
targets may or may not be referred to in the tweets,
and they may or may not be the target of opinion in the tweets.
We develop a simple stance detection system that outperforms all 19 teams that
participated in a recent shared task competition on the same dataset.
Additionally, access to both stance and sentiment annotations allows us to
conduct several experiments 
to tease out their interactions.
We show that
while sentiment features  are useful for stance classification, they alone are
not sufficient.
We also show the impacts of various features on detecting stance and sentiment,
respectively.
