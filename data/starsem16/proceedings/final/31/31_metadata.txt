Abstract#==#We investigate style accommodation in online discussions, in particular its
interplay with content agreement and disagreement. Using a new model for
measuring style accommodation, we find that speakers coordinate on style more
noticeably if they disagree than if they agree, especially if they want to
establish  rapport and possibly persuade their interlocutors.
