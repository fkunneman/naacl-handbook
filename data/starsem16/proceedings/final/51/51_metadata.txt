Abstract#==#Extending semantic role labeling (SRL) to detect and recover non-local
arguments continues to be a challenge. Our work is the first to address the
detection of implicit roles from a multilingual perspective. We map
predicate-argument structures across English and German sentences, and we
develop a classifier that distinguishes implicit arguments from other
translation shifts. Using a combination of alignment statistics and linguistic
features, we achieve a precision of 0.68 despite a limited training set, which
is a significant gain over the majority baseline. Our approach does not rely on
pre-existing knowledge bases and is extendible to any language pair with
parallel data and dependency parses.
