Abstract#==#In this paper, we explore the role of constituent properties in English and
German noun-noun compounds (corpus frequencies of the compounds and their
constituents; productivity and ambiguity of the constituents; and semantic
relations between the constituents), when predicting the degrees of
compositionality of the compounds within a vector space model. The results
demonstrate that the empirical and semantic properties of the compounds and the
head nouns play a significant role.
