Abstract#==#Users combine attributes and types to describe and classify entities into
categories. These categories are fundamental for organising knowledge in a
decentralised way acting as tags and predicates. When searching for entities,
categories frequently describes the search query. Considering that users do not
know in which terms the categories are expressed, they might query the same
concept by a paraphrase. While some categories are composed of simple
expressions (e.g. Presidents of Ireland), others have more complex
compositional patterns (e.g. French Senators Of The Second Empire). This work
proposes a hybrid semantic model based on syntactic analysis, distributional
semantics and named entity recognition to recognise paraphrases of entity
categories. Our results show that the proposed model outperformed the
comparative baseline, in terms of recall and mean reciprocal rank, thus being
suitable for addressing the vocabulary gap between user queries and entity
categories.
