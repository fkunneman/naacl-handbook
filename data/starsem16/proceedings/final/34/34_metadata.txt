Abstract#==#A difficult task when generating text from  knowledge bases (KB) consists in
finding appropriate lexicalisations for KB symbols. We present an approach for
lexicalising knowledge base relations and apply it to DBPedia data. Our model
learns low-dimensional embeddings of words and RDF resources and uses these
representations to score RDF properties against candidate lexicalisations.
Training our model using (i) pairs of RDF triples and automatically generated
verbalisations of these triples and (ii) pairs of paraphrases extracted from
various resources, yields competitive results on DBPedia data.
