Abstract#==#We describe a new technique for improving
    statistical machine translation training by adopting scores from a recent
    crosslingual semantic frame based evaluation metric, XMEANT, as outside
    probabilities in expectation-maximization based ITG (inversion transduction
    grammars) alignment. Our new approach strongly biases early-stage SMT
    learning towards semantically valid alignments. Unlike previous attempts
    that have proposed using semantic frame based evaluation metrics as the
    objective function for late-stage tuning of less than a dozen loglinear
    mixture weights, our approach instead applies the semantic metric at one of
    the earliest stages of SMT training, where it may impact millions of model
    parameters. The choice of XMEANT is motivated by empirical studies that
have
    shown ITG constraints to cover almost all crosslingual semantic frame
    alternations, which resemble the crosslingual semantic frame matching
    measured by XMEANT. Our experiments purposely restrict training data to
    small amounts to show the technique's utility in the absence of a huge
    corpus, to study the effects of semantic generalizations while avoiding
    overreliance on memorization. Results show that directly driving ITG
    training with the crosslingual semantic frame based objective function not
    only helps to further sharpen the ITG constraints, but still avoids
excising
    relevant portions of the search space, and leads to better performance than
    either conventional ITG or GIZA++ based approaches.
