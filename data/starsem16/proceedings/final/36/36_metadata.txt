Abstract#==#Conventional word sense induction (WSI)
methods usually represent each instance
with discrete linguistic features or cooccurrence
features, and train a model
for each polysemous word individually.
In this work, we propose to learn sense
embeddings for the WSI task. In the
training stage, our method induces several
sense centroids (embedding) for each
polysemous word. In the testing stage,
our method represents each instance as a
contextual vector, and induces its sense
by finding the nearest sense centroid in
the embedding space. The advantages
of our method are (1) distributed sense
vectors are taken as the knowledge representations
which are trained discriminatively,
and usually have better performance
than traditional count-based distributional
models, and (2) a general model
for the whole vocabulary is jointly trained
to induce sense centroids under the mutlitask
learning framework. Evaluated on
SemEval-2010 WSI dataset, our method
outperforms all participants and most of
the recent state-of-the-art methods. We
further verify the two advantages by comparing
with carefully designed baselines.
