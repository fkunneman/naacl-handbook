Abstract#==#Givenness (Schwarzschild, 1999) is one of the central notions in the formal
pragmatic literature discussing the organization of dis- course. In this paper,
we explore where distributional semantics can help address the gap between the
linguistic insights into the formal pragmatic notion of Givenness and its
implementation in computational linguistics.

As experimental testbed, we focus on short answer assessment, in which the goal
is to assess whether a student response correctly answers the provided reading
comprehen- sion question or not. Current approaches only implement a very
basic, surface-based perspective on Givenness: A word of the answer that
appears as such in the question counts as GIVEN.

We show that an approach approximating Givenness using distributional semantics
to check whether a word in a sentence is similar enough to a word in the
context to count as GIVEN is more successful quantitatively and supports
interesting qualitative insights into the data and the limitations of a basic
distributional semantic approach identifying Givenness at the lexical level.
