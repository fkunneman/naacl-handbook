Abstract#==#It is generally believed that a metaphor tends to have a stronger emotional
impact than a literal statement; however, there is no quantitative study
establishing the extent to which this is true.
  Further, the mechanisms through which metaphors convey emotions are
  not well understood. We present the first data-driven study comparing
  the emotionality of metaphorical expressions with that
  of their literal counterparts. Our results indicate that metaphorical usages
  are, on average, significantly more emotional than literal usages.
 We also show that this emotional content is not simply transferred from the
source domain into the target, but rather is a result of meaning composition
and interaction of the two domains in the metaphor.
