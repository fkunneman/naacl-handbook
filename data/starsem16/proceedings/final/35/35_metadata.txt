Abstract#==#The interpretation of adjective-noun pairs plays a crucial role in tasks such
as recognizing textual entailment. Formal semantics often places adjectives
into a taxonomy which should dictate adjectives' entailment behavior when
placed in adjective-noun compounds.  However, we show experimentally that the
behavior of subsective adjectives (e.g. red) versus non-subsective adjectives
(e.g. fake) is not as cut and dry as often assumed. For example, inferences are
not always symmetric: while ID is generally considered to be mutually exclusive
with fake ID, fake ID is considered to entail ID. We discuss the implications
of these findings for automated natural language understanding.
