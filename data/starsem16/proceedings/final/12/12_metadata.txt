Abstract#==#In a complex sentence comprised of one or more subclauses, the 
overt or hidden attitudes between the various entities depend
on the factuality projection of the verbs, their polar effects,
and the modality and affirmative status (negated or not) of the clauses.
If factuality is given, some referents might even be considered to benefit 
or to suffer from the (effects of the) described situation, independently of
their 
relations to the other referents. 
An interesting question is, how the reader evaluates all this from
his/her perspective. 
We introduce an approach based on Description Logics that 
integrates these various perspectives into a joint model.
