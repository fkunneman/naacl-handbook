Abstract#==#In this paper, we aim to close the gap from extensive, human-built semantic
resources and corpus-driven unsupervised models. The particular resource
explored here is VerbNet, whose organizing principle is that semantics and
syntax are linked. To capture patterns of usage that can augment knowledge
resources like VerbNet, we expand a Dirichlet process mixture model to predict
a
VerbNet class for each sense of each verb, allowing us to incorporate annotated
VerbNet data to guide the clustering process. The resulting clusters align more
closely to hand-curated syntactic/semantic groupings than any previous models,
and can be adapted to new domains since they require only corpus counts.
