Abstract#==#Recent models in distributional semantics consider derivational patterns (e.g.,
use -> use + ful ) as the result of a compositional process, where base term
and
affix are combined. We exploit such models for German particle verbs (PVs), and
focus on the task of learning a mapping function between base verbs and
particle verbs. Our models apply particle-verb motivated training-space
restrictions relying on nearest neighbors, as well as recent advances from
zero-shot-learning. The models improve the mapping between base terms and
derived terms for a new PV derivation dataset, and also across existing
derivation datasets for German and English.
