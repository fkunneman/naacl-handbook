Abstract#==#Reasoning over several premises is not a common feature of RTE systems as it
usually requires deep semantic analysis.
On the other hand, FraCaS is a collection of entailment problems consisting of
multiple premises and covering semantically challenging phenomena.
We employ the tableau theorem prover for natural language to solve the FraCsS
problems in a {\em natural} way.
The expressiveness of a type theory, the transparency of natural logic and the
schematic nature of tableau inference rules make it easy to model challenging
semantic phenomena.  
The efficiency of theorem proving also becomes challenging when reasoning over
several premises.
After adapting to the dataset, the prover demonstrates state-of-the-art
competence over certain sections of FraCaS.
