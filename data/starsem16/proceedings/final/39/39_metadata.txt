Abstract#==#Learning embeddings of words and
knowledge base elements is a promising
approach for open domain question
answering. Based on the remark that
relations and entities are distinct object
types lying in the same embedding
space, we analyze the benefit of adding
a regularizer favoring the embeddings
of entities to be orthogonal to those of
relations. The main motivation comes
from the observation that modifying the
embeddings using prior knowledge often
helps performances. The experiments
show that incorporating the regularizer
yields better results on a challenging
question answering benchmark.
