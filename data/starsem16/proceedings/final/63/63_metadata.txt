Abstract#==#This paper presents a rule-based approach to constructing lexical axioms from
WordNet verb entries in an expressive semantic representation, Episodic Logic
(EL). EL differs from other representations in being syntactically close to
natural language and covering phenomena such as generalized quantification,
modification, and intensionality while still allowing highly effective
inference. The presented approach uses a novel preprocessing technique to
improve parsing precision of coordinators and incorporates frames, hand-tagged
word senses, and examples from WordNet to achieve highly consistent semantic
interpretations. EL allows the full content of glosses to be incorporated into
  the formal lexical axioms, without sacrificing interpretive accuracy, or
verb-to-verb inference accuracy on a standard test set.

Evaluation of semantic parser performance is based on \textit{EL-match},
introduced here as a generalization of the \textit{smatch} metric for semantic
structure accuracy. On gloss  parses, the approach achieves an
\textit{EL-match} F1 score of 0.83, and a whole-axiom F1 score of 0.45; verb
entailment identification based on extracted axioms is competitive with the
state-of-the-art.
