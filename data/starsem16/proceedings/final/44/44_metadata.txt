Abstract#==#Distributional semantic models are able to predict many linguistic phenomena,
including word similarity, lexical ambiguity, and semantic priming, or even to
pass TOEFL synonymy and analogy tests (Landauer and Dumais, 1997; Griffiths et
al., 2007; Turney and Pantel, 2010). But what does it take to create a
competitive distributional model? Levy et al. (2015) argue that the key to
success lies largely in hyperparameter tuning rather than in the model’s
architecture. More parameters trivially lead to potential performance
improvements, but what do they actually do to improve the models? Are
individual parameters’ contributions independent of each other? Or are only
specific parameter combinations beneficial? To answer these questions, we
perform a quantitative and qualitative evaluation of major hyperparameters as
identified in previous research.
