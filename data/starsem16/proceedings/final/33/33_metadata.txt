Abstract#==#Segmenting text into semantically coherent fragments improves readability of
text and facilitates tasks like text summarization and passage retrieval. In
this paper, we present a novel unsupervised algorithm for linear text
segmentation (TS) that exploits word embeddings and a measure of semantic
relatedness of short texts to construct a semantic relatedness graph of the
document. Semantically coherent segments are then derived from maximal cliques
of the relatedness graph. The algorithm performs competitively on a standard
synthetic dataset and outperforms the best-performing method on a real-world
(i.e., non-artificial) dataset of political manifestos.
