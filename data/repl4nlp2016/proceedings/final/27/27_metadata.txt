Abstract#==#Vector models of distributional semantics can be viewed as a geometric
interpretation of a fragment of dependent type theory. By extending to a bigger
fragment to include the dependent product we achieve a significant increase in
expressive power of vector models, which allows for an implementation of
contextual adaptation of word meanings in the compositional setting.
