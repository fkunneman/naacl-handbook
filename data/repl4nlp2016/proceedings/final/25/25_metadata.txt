Abstract#==#Community Question Answering forums, such as Quora and Stackoverflow contain
millions of questions and answers. Automatically finding the relevant questions
from the existing questions and finding the relevant answers to a new question
are Natural Language Processing tasks. In this paper, we aim to address these
tasks, which we refer to as similar-Question Retrieval and Answer Selection. We
present a neural-based model with stacked bidirectional LSTMs and MLPs to
address these tasks. The model generates the vector representations of the
question-question or question-answer pairs and computes their semantic
similarity scores, which are then employed to rank and predict relevancies.
Extensive experiments demonstrate our results outperform the baselines.
