Abstract#==#This paper presents a deep architecture for
learning a similarity metric on variable-
length character sequences. The model
combines a stack of character-level bidi-
rectional LSTM’s with a Siamese archi-
tecture. It learns to project variable-
length strings into a fixed-dimensional em-
bedding space by using only informa-
tion about the similarity between pairs of
strings. This model is applied to the task
of job title normalization based on a manu-
ally annotated taxonomy. A small data set
is incrementally expanded and augmented
with new sources of variance. The model
learns a representation that is selective to
differences in the input that reflect seman-
tic differences (e.g., "Java developer" vs.
"HR manager") but also invariant to non-
semantic string differences (e.g., "Java de-
veloper" vs. "Java programmer").
