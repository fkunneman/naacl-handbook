Abstract#==#This paper presents a novel model that learns and exploits embeddings of phone
ngrams for word segmentation in child language acquisition. Embedding-based
models are evaluated on a phonemically transcribed corpus of child-directed
speech,in comparison with their symbolic counterparts using the common learning
framework and features. Results show that learning embeddings signiﬁcantly
improves performance. We make use of extensive visualization to understand what
the model has learned. We show that the learned embeddings are informative for
both word segmentation and phonology in general.
