Abstract#==#A long-term goal of machine learning is to build an intelligent dialogue agent
that is capable of learning associations within data and using them to
understand and answer questions and make relevant recommendations. The Facebook
Movie DialogDataset (MDD) was recently proposed in Dodge et al. (2016) to
evaluate the comparative performance of dialogue agent systems. However, a
structural analysis of the data for the recommendation tasks suggests that
there may be some flaws in the design of the dataset.
