Abstract#==#In this work, we evaluate different sentence encoders with emphasis on
examining their embedding spaces. Specifically, we hypothesize that a
"high-quality" embedding aids in generalization, promoting transfer learning as
well as zero-shot and one-shot learning. To investigate this, we modify
Skipthought vectors to learn a more generalizable space by exploiting a small
amount of supervision. The aim is to introduce an additional notion of
similarity in the embeddings, rendering the vectors informative for different
tasks requiring less "adaptation". Our embeddings capture human intuition on
similarity favorably that competing models, while we also show positive
indications of transfer from the task of natural language inference to
paraphrase detection and paraphrase ranking. Further, our model's behaviour on
paraphrase detection when trained with an increasing amount of labelled data is
indicative of a generalizable model. Finally, we support our hypothesis on
generalizability of our embeddings through inspection of their statistics.
