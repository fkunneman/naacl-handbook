Abstract#==#Word embeddings are widely used nowadays
for many NLP tasks. They reduce the
dimensionality of the vocabulary space,
but most importantly they should capture
(part of) the meaning of words. The new
vector space used by the embeddings allows
computation of semantic distances
between words, while some word embeddings
also permit simple vector operations
(e.g. summation, difference) resembling
analogical reasoning. This paper proposes
a new operation on word embeddings
aimed to capturing categorical information
by first learning and then applying
an embedding mask for each analyzed
category. Thus, we conducted a series
of experiments related to categorization of
words based on their embeddings. Several
classical approaches were compared
together with the one introduced in the paper
which uses different embedding masks
learnt for each category.
