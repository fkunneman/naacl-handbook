Abstract#==#We introduce PDD (Pair Distance Distribution), a novel corpus-based model of
semantic representation. Most corpus-based models are VSMs (Vector Space
Models), which while being successful, suffer from both practical and
theoretical shortcomings. VSM models produce very large, sparse matrices, and
dimensionality reduction is usually performed, leading to high computational
complexity, and obscuring the meaning of the dimensions. Similarity in VSMs is
constrained to be both symmetric and transitive, contrary to evidence from
human subject tests. PDD is feature-based, created automatically from corpora
without producing large, sparse matrices. The dimensions along which words are
compared are meaningful, enabling better understanding of the model and
providing an explanation as to how any two words are similar. Similarity is
neither symmetric nor transitive. The model achieved accuracy of 97.6% on a
published semantic similarity test
