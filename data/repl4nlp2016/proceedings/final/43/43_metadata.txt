Abstract#==#We study the event detection problem in the new type extension setting. In
particular, our task involves identifying the event instances of a target type
that is only specified by a small set of seed instances in text. We want to
exploit the large amount of training data available for the other event types
to improve the performance of this task. We compare the convolutional neural
network model and the feature-based method in this type extension setting to
investigate their effectiveness. In addition, we propose a two-stage training
algorithm for neural networks that effectively transfers knowledge from the
other event types to the target type. The experimental results show that the
proposed algorithm outperforms strong baselines for this task.
