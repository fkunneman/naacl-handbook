Abstract#==#We present a simple yet effective approach for learning word sense embeddings.
In contrast to existing techniques, which either directly learn sense
representations from corpora or rely on sense inventories from lexical
resources, our approach induces a sense inventory using existing word
embeddings via clustering of ego-networks of related words. An integrated WSD
mechanism enables labeling of word occurrences in context with the learned
sense vectors, which gives rise to downstream applications. Experiments show
that the performance of our method is comparable to  state-of-the-art
unsupervised WSD systems.
