Abstract#==#We present a state-of-the-art algorithm for measuring the semantic similarity
of word pairs using novel combinations of word embeddings, WordNet, and the
concept dictionary 4lang. We evaluate our system on the SimLex-999 benchmark
data. Our top score of 0.755 is higher than any published system that we are
aware of, well beyond the average inter-annotator agreement of 0.67, and close
to the 0.78 average correlation between a human rater and the average of all
other ratings, suggesting that our system has achieved near-human performance
on this benchmark.
