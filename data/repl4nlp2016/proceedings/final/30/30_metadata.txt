Abstract#==#Word representations are a fundamental component for many natural language
processing tasks. In this paper, we propose a generic energy-based model,
MsVec, 
which is capable of learning word representations from multiple information
sources. We instantiate the proposed generic model as dep-MsVec by emphasizing
sentences' syntactic dependency information. Experimental results show a boost
in word analogy tasks, especially in syntactic aspects, as expected.
