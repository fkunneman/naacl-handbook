Abstract#==#Semantic lexicons such as WordNet and PPDB have been used to improve the
vector-based semantic representations of words by adjusting the word vectors.
However, such lexicons lack semantic intensity information, inhibiting
adjustment
of vector spaces to better represent semantic intensity scales. In this work,
we adjust word vectors using the semantic intensity information in addition to
synonyms and antonyms from WordNet and PPDB, and show improved performance on
judging semantic intensity orders of adjective pairs on three different human
annotated datasets.
