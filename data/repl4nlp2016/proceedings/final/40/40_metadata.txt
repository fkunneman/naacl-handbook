Abstract#==#In this paper we present a study covering the creation of compositional
distributional representations for English noun compounds (e.g. computer
science) using two compositional models proposed in the literature. The
compositional representations are first evaluated based on their similarity to
the corresponding corpus-learned representations and then on the task of
automatic classification of semantic relations for English noun compounds. Our
experiments show that compositional models are able to build meaningful
representations for more than half of the test set compounds. However, using
pre-trained compositional models does not lead to the expected performance
gains for the semantic relation classification task. Models using compositional
representations have a similar performance as a basic classification model,
despite the advantage of being pre-trained on a large set of compounds.
