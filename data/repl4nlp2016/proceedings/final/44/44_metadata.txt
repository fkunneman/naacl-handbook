Abstract#==#We consider the problem of Recognizing Textual Entailment within an Information
Retrieval context, where we must simultaneously determine the relevancy as well
as degree of entailment for individual pieces of evidence to determine a yes/no
answer to a binary natural language question.

We compare several variants of neural networks for sentence embeddings in a
setting of decision-making based on evidence of varying relevance.  We propose
a basic model to integrate evidence for entailment, show that joint training of
the sentence embeddings to model relevance and entailment is feasible even with
no explicit per-evidence supervision, and show the importance of evaluating
strong baselines.  We also demonstrate the benefit of carrying over text
comprehension model trained on an unrelated task for our small datasets.

Our research is motivated primarily by a new open dataset we introduce,
consisting of binary questions and news-based evidence snippets.  We also apply
the proposed relevance-entailment model on a similar task of ranking
multiple-choice test answers, evaluating it on a preliminary dataset of school
test questions as well as the standard MCTest dataset, where we improve the
neural model state-of-art.
