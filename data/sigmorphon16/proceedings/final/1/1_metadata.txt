Abstract#==#For languages such as German where compounds occur frequently and are written
as single tokens, a wide variety of NLP applications benefits from recognizing
and splitting compounds. As the traditional word frequency-based approach to
compound splitting has several drawbacks, this paper introduces a letter
sequence labeling approach, which can utilize rich word form features to build
discriminative learning models that are optimized for splitting. Experiments
show that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
compound splitters.
