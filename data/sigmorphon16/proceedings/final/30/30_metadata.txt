Abstract#==#Morphological reinflection is the task of generating a target form given a
source form and the morpho-syntactic attributes of the target (and, optionally,
of the source). This work presents the submission of Bar Ilan University and
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for the morphological reinflection
shared task held at SIGMORPHON 2016. The submission includes two recurrent
neural network architectures for learning morphological reinflection from
incomplete inflection tables while using several novel ideas for this task:
morpho-syntactic attribute embeddings, modeling the concept of templatic
morphology, bidirectional input character representations and neural
discriminative string transduction. The reported results for the proposed
models over the ten languages in the shared task bring this submission to the
second/third place (depending on the language) on all three sub-tasks out of
eight participating teams, while training only on the Restricted category data.
