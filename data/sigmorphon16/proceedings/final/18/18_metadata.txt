Abstract#==#This paper presents an approach for the formal representation 
of components in German compounds. 
We assume that such a formal representation 
will support the segmentation and analysis of unseen compounds that
feature components already seen in other compounds. 
An extensive language resource that explicitly 
codes components of compounds is GermaNet, a lexical semantic network for
German. We summarize the GermaNet approach to the description of compounds,
discussing some of its shortcomings. 
Our proposed extension of this representation 
builds on the lemon lexicon model for ontologies,
established by the W3C Ontology Lexicon Community Group.
