Abstract#==#Recent work has proposed using network science to analyze the structure of the
mental lexicon by viewing words as nodes in a phonological network, with edges
connecting words that differ by a single phoneme. Comparing the structure of
phonological networks across different languages could provide insights into
linguistic typology and the cognitive pressures that shape language
acquisition, evolution, and processing. However, previous studies have not
considered how statistics gathered from these networks are affected by factors
such as lexicon size and the distribution of word lengths. We show that these
factors can substantially affect the statistics of a phonological network and
propose a new method for making more robust comparisons. We then analyze eight
languages, finding many commonalities but also some qualitative differences in
their lexicon structure.
