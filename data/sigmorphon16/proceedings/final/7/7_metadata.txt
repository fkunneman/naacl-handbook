Abstract#==#In this paper I present a k-means clustering approach 
  to inferring morphological
  position classes (morphotactics)
  from Interlinear Glossed Text (IGT), data collections available for 
  some endangered and low-resource languages.
  While the experiment is not restricted to low-resource
  languages,
  they are meant to be the targeted domain.
  Specifically my approach is meant to be 
  for field linguists who do not necessarily
  know how many position classes there are
  in the language they work with and what
  the position classes are, but have the expertise
  to evaluate different hypotheses.
  It builds on an existing approach (Wax,2014), 
but replaces the core heuristic
  with a clustering algorithm. 
  The results mainly illustrate two points.
  First, they are largely negative,
  which shows that the baseline algorithm (summarized in the paper)
  uses a very predictive feature to determine whether affixes
  belong to the same position class, namely edge overlap in the affix graph. 
  At the same time, unlike the baseline method that relies entirely on a single
feature,
  k-means clustering can account for different features and helps discover
  more morphological phenomena, e.g. circumfixation.
  I conclude that unsupervised learning algorithms such as 
  k-means clustering can in principle be used
  for morphotactics inference, though the
  algorithm should probably weigh certain features
  more than others. Most importantly, I conclude that
  clustering is a promising approach for diverse
  morphotactics and as such it 
  can facilitate
  linguistic analysis of field languages.
