Abstract#==#This work examines CRF-based sequence alignment models for learning natural
language morphology. Although these systems have performed well for a limited
number of languages, this work, as part of the SigMorPhon 2016 shared task,
specifically sets out to determine whether these models handle
non-concatenative morphology as well as previous work might suggest. Results,
however, indicate a strong preference for simpler, concatenative morphological
systems.
