Abstract#==#It is commonly accepted that morphological dependencies are finite-state in
nature. We argue that the upper bound on morphological expressivity is much
lower. Drawing on technical results from computational phonology, we show that
a variety of morphotactic phenomena are tier-based strictly local and do not
fall into weaker subclasses such as the strictly local or strictly piecewise
languages. Since the tier-based strictly local languages are learnable in the
limit from positive texts, this marks a first important step towards general
machine learning algorithms for morphology. Furthermore, the limitation to
tier-based strictly local languages explains typological gaps that are puzzling
from a purely linguistic perspective.
