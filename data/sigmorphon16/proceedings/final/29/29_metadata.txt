Abstract#==#This paper describes our participation in the SIGMORPHON 2016 shared task on
morphological reinflection. In the task, we use a linear-chain conditional
random field model to learn to map sequences of input characters to sequences
of output characters and focus on developing features that are useful for
predicting inflectional behavior. Since the training data in the task is
limited, we also generalize the training data by extracting, in an unsupervised
fashion, the types of consonant-vowel sequences that trigger inflectional
behavior, and by extending the available training data through inference of
unlabeled morphosyntactic descriptions.
