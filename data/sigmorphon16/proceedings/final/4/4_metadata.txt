Abstract#==#Conversion is a word formation operation that changes the grammatical category
of a word in the absence of overt morphology. Conversion is extremely
productive in English (e.g., tunnel, talk). This paper investigates whether
distributional information can be used to predict the diachronic direction of
conversion for homophonous noun–verb pairs. We aim to predict, for example,
that tunnel was used as a noun prior to its use as a verb. We test two
hypotheses: (1) that derived forms are less frequent than their bases, and (2)
that derived forms are more semantically specific than their bases, as
approximated by information theoretic measures. We find that hypothesis (1)
holds for N-to-V conversion, while hypothesis (2) holds for V-to-N conversion.
We achieve the best overall account of the historical data by taking both
frequency and semantic specificity into account. These results provide a new
perspective on linguistic theories regarding the semantic specificity of
derivational morphemes, and on the morphosyntactic status of conversion.
