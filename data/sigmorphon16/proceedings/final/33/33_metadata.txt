Abstract#==#This paper presents MED, the main system of the LMU team for the SIGMORPHON
2016 Shared Task on Morphological Reinflection as well as an extended analysis
of how different design choices contribute to the final performance. We model
the task of morphological reinflection using neural encoder-decoder models
together with an encoding of the input as a single sequence of the
morphological tags of the source and target form as well as the sequence of
letters of the source form. The Shared Task consists of three subtasks, three
different tracks and covers 10 different languages to encourage the use of
language-independent approaches. MED was the system with the overall best
performance, demonstrating our method generalizes well for the low-resource
setting of the SIGMORPHON 2016 Shared Task.
