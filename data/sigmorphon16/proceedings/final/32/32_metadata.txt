Abstract#==#This paper presents an algorithm for automatic word forms inflection. We use
the method of longest common subsequence to extract abstract paradigms from
given pairs of basic and inflected word forms, as well as suffix and prefix
features to predict this paradigm automatically. We elaborate this algorithm
using combination of affix feature-based and character ngram models, which
substantially enhances performance especially for the languages possessing
nonlocal phenomena such as vowel harmony. Our system took part in SIGMORPHON
2016 Shared Task and took third place in 17 of 30 subtasks and fourth place in
7 substasks among 7 participants.
