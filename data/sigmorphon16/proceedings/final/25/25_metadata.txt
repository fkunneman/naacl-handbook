Abstract#==#We present a system for morphological reinflection based on an
encoder-decoder neural network model with extra convolutional layers. In spite
of its simplicity, the method performs reasonably well on all the languages of
the SIGMORPHON 2016 shared task, particularly for the most challenging task of
limited-resources reinflection. We also find that using only convolution
achieves surprisingly good results in this task, surpassing the accuracy of our
encoder-decoder model for several languages.
