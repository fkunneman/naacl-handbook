Abstract#==#This paper presents a proposal for learning morphological inflections by a
grapheme-to-phoneme learning model. No special processing is used for specific
languages.
The starting point has been our previous research on induction of phonology and
morphology for normalization of historical texts. The results show that a very
simple method can indeed improve upon some baselines, but does not overcome the
best systems in the task.
