Abstract#==#Three popular vocal-tract animation paradigms were tested for intelligibility
when displaying videos of pre-recorded Electromagnetic Articulography (EMA)
data in an online experiment. EMA tracks the position of sensors attached to
the tongue.
The conditions were dots with tails (where only the coil location is
presented), 2D animation (where the dots are connected to form 2D
representations of the lips, tongue surface and chin), and a 3D model with coil
locations driving facial and tongue rigs.
The 2D animation (recorded in VisArtico) showed the highest identification of
the prompts.
