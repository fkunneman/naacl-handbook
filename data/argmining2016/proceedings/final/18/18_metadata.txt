Abstract#==#In this paper we examine the application of an unsupervised extractive
summarisation algorithm, TextRank, on a different task, the identification of
argumentative components. Our main motivation is to examine whether there is
any potential overlap between extractive summarisation and argument mining,
and whether approaches used in summarisation (which typically model a document
as a whole) can have a positive effect on tasks of argument mining. Evaluation
has been performed on two corpora containing user posts from an on-line
debating forum and persuasive essays. Evaluation results suggest that
graph-based approaches and approaches targeting extractive summarisation can
have a positive effect on tasks related to argument mining.
