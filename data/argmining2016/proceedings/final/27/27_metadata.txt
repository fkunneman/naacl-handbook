Abstract#==#Existing approaches to summarizing multi-party argumentative conversations in
reader comment are extractive and fail to capture the argumentative nature of
these conversations. Work on argument mining proposes schemes for identifying
argument elements and relations in text but has not yet addressed how summaries
might be generated from a global analysis of a conversation based on these
schemes. In this paper we: (1) propose an issue-centred scheme for analysing 
and graphically representing argument in reader comment discussion in on-line
news, and (2) show how summaries capturing the argumentative nature of reader
comment can be generated from our graphical representation.
