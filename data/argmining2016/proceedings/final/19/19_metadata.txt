Abstract#==#The annotation of argument schemes represents an important step for
argumentation
mining. General guidelines for the annotation of argument schemes, applicable
to any topic, are still missing due to the lack of a suitable taxonomy in
Argumentation
Theory and the need for highly trained expert annotators. We present a set
of guidelines for the annotation of argument schemes, taking as a framework the
Argumentum Model of Topics (Rigotti and Morasso, 2010; Rigotti, 2009). We show
that this approach can contribute to solving the theoretical problems, since it
offers
a hierarchical and finite taxonomy of argument schemes as well as systematic,
linguistically-informed criteria to distinguish various types of argument
schemes.
We describe a pilot annotation study of 30 persuasive essays using multiple
minimally
trained non-expert annotators .Our findings from the confusion matrixes
pinpoint
problematic parts of the guidelines and the underlying annotation of claims
and premises. We conduct a second annotation with refined guidelines and
trained
annotators on the 10 essays which received the lowest agreement initially. A
significant
improvement of the inter-annotator agreement shows that the annotation of
argument
schemes requires highly trained annotators and an accurate annotation of
argumentative components (premises and claims).
