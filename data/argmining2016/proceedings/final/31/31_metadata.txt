Abstract#==#Identifying the main claims occurring across texts is important for large-scale
argumentation mining from social media. However, the claims that users make are
often unclear and build on implicit knowledge, effectively introducing a gap
between the claims.  In this work, we study the problem of matching user claims
to predefined main claims, using implicit premises to fill the gap. We build
a dataset with implicit premises and analyze how human annotators fill the
gaps.  We then experiment with computational claim matching models that utilize
these premises. We show that using manually-compiled premises improves
similarity-based claim matching and that premises generalize to unseen user
claims.
