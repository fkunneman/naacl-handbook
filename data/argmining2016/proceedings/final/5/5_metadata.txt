Abstract#==#In recent years, social media has revolutionized how people communicate and
share in-formation. One function of social media, besides connecting with
friends, is sharing opinions with others. Microblogging sites, like Twitter,
have often provided an online forum for social activism. When users debate
about controversial topics on social media, they typically share different
types of evidence to support their claims. Classifying these types of evidence
can provide an estimate for how adequately the arguments have been supported.
We first introduce a manually built gold standard dataset of 3000 tweets
related to the recent FBI and Apple encryption debate. We develop a framework
for automatically classifying six evidence types typically used on Twitter to
discuss the debate. Our findings show that a Support Vector Machine (SVM)
classifier trained with n-gram and additional features is capable of capturing
the different forms of representing evidence on Twitter, and exhibits
significant improvements over the unigram baseline, achieving an F1
macro-averaged of 82.8%.
