Abstract#==#This paper describes and evaluates a novel feature set for stance
classification of argumentative texts; i.e. deciding whether a post by a user
is for or against the issue being debated. We model the debate both as attitude
bearing  features, including a set of automatically acquired `topic terms'
associated with a Distributional Lexical Model (DLM) that captures the
writerâ€™s attitude towards the topic term, and as dependency features that
represent the points being made in the debate. The stance of the text towards
the issue being debated is then learnt in a supervised framework as a function
of these features. The main advantage of our feature set is that it is
scrutable: The reasons for a classification can be explained to a human user in
natural language. We also report that our method outperforms previous
approaches to stance classification as well as a range of baselines based on
sentiment analysis and topic-sentiment analysis.
