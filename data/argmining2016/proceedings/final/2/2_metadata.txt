Abstract#==#Evidences that support a claim "a subject phrase promotes or suppresses a
value" help in making a rational decision.
We aim to construct a model that can classify if a particular evidence supports
a claim of a promoting/suppressing relationship given an arbitrary
subject-value pair.
In this paper, we propose a recurrent neural network (RNN) with an attention
model to classify such evidences.
We incorporated a word embedding technique in an attention model such that our
method generalizes for never-encountered subjects and value phrases.
Benchmarks showed that the method outperforms conventional methods in evidence
classification tasks.
