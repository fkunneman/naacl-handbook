Abstract#==#In this paper, we propose a task for quality evaluation of disputing argument.
In order to understand the disputation behavior, we propose three sub-tasks,
detecting disagreement hierarchy, refutation method and argumentation strategy
respectively. We first manually labeled a real dataset collected from an online
debating forum. The dataset includes 45 disputing argument pairs. The
annotation scheme is developed by three NLP researchers via annotating all the
argument pairs in the dataset. Two under-graduate students are then trained to
annotate the same dataset. We report annotation results from both groups. Then,
another larger dataset was annotated and we show analysis of the correlation
between disputing quality and different disputation behaviors.
