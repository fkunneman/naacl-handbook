Abstract#==#Online communities host growing numbers of discussions amongst large groups of
participants on all manner of topics. This user-generated content contains
millions of statements of opinions and ideas. 
We propose an abstractive approach to summarize such argumentative discussions,
making key content accessible through `point' extraction, where a point is a
verb and its syntactic arguments. Our approach uses both dependency parse
information and verb case frames to identify and extract valid points, and
generates an abstractive summary that discusses the key points being made in
the debate. We performed a human evaluation of our approach using a corpus of
online political debates and report significant improvements over a
high-performing extractive summarizer.
