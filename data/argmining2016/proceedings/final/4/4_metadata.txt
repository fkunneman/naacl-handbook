Abstract#==#Topic-independent expressions for conveying agreement and disagreement were
annotated in a corpus of web forum debates, in order to evaluate a classifier
trained to detect these two categories.  Among the 175              expressions
annotated
in the evaluation set, 163 were unique, which shows that there is large
variation in expressions used. This variation might be one of the reasons why
the task of automatically detecting the categories was difficult. F-scores of
0.44 and 0.37 were achieved by a classifier trained on 2,000 debate sentences
for detecting sentence-level agreement and disagreement.
