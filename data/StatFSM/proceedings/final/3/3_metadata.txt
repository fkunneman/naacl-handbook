Abstract#==#This paper presents two systems for spelling correction formulated as a
sequence labeling task. One of the systems is an unstructured classifier and
the other one is structured. Both systems are implemented using weighted
finite-state methods. The structured system delivers state-of-the-art results
on the task of tweet normalization when compared with the recent AliSeTra
system introduced by \newcite{Eger2016} even though the system presented in the
paper is simpler than AliSeTra because it does not include a model for input
segmentation. In addition to experiments on tweet normalization, we present
experiments on OCR post-processing using an Early Modern Finnish corpus of OCR
processed newspaper text.
