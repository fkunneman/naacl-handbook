Abstract#==#We present Pynini, an open-source library for the compilation of weighted
finite-state transducers (WFSTs) and pushdown transducers (PDTs) from strings,
context-dependent rewrite rules, and recursive transition networks. Pynini uses
the OpenFst library for encoding, modifying, and applying WFSTs and PDTs. We
describe the design of this library and the algorithms and interfaces used for
compilation, optimization, and application, and illustrate its use.
