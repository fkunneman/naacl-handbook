Abstract#==#Encoding unranked trees to binary trees, henceforth called binarization, is an
important method to deal with unranked trees. For each of three binarizations
we show that weighted (ranked) tree automata together with the binarization are
equivalent to weighted unranked tree automata; even in the probabilistic case.
This allows to easily adapt training methods for weighted (ranked) tree
automata to weighted unranked tree automata.
