Abstract#==#Compositional matrix-space models of language were recently proposed for the
task of meaning representation of complex text structures in natural language
processing. These models have been shown to be a theoretically elegant way to
model compositionality in natural language. However, in practical cases,
appropriate methods are required to learn such models by automatically
acquiring the necessary token-to-matrix assignments. In this paper, we
introduce graded matrix grammars of natural language, a variant of the matrix
grammars proposed by \newcite{Rudolph:2010}, and show a close correspondence
between this matrix-space model and weighted finite automata. We conclude that
the problem of learning compositional matrix-space models can be mapped to the
problem of learning weighted finite automata over the real numbers.
