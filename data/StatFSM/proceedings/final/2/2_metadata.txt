Abstract#==#We develop the concept of weighted aligned hypergraph bimorphism where the
weights may, in particular, represent probabilities. Such a bimorphism consists
of an bilities. Such a bimorphism consists of an R≥0-weighted regular tree
grammar, two hypergraph algebras that interpret the generated trees, and a
family of alignments between the two interpretations. Semantically, this yields
a set of bihypergraphs each consisting of two hypergraphs and an explicit
alignment between them; e.g., discontinuous phrase structures and
non-projective dependency structures are bihypergraphs. We present an
EM-training algorithm which takes a corpus of bihypergraphs and an aligned
hypergraph bimorphism as input and generates a sequence of weight assignments
which converges to a local maximum or saddle point of the likelihood function
of the corpus.
