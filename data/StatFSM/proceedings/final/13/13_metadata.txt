Abstract#==#In this paper, we present a method to convert morphological inflection tables
into unweighted and weighted finite transducers that perform parsing and
generation.  These transducers model the inflectional behavior of morphological
paradigms induced from examples and can map inflected forms of previously
unseen word forms into their lemmas and give morphosyntactic descriptions of
them.  The system is evaluated on several languages with data collected from
the Wiktionary.
