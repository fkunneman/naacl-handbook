\section{Meal Info}{}

The following meals are provided as part of your registration fee:

\begin{itemize}
\item 
\item Mid-Morning and Mid-Afternoon breaks include coffee and tea in the Main Building
\item A full dinner buffer is provided during the poster sessions on Monday and Tuesday evenings in the Maritim Hotel  
\end{itemize} 

Every participant is free to make own arrangements during lunch time. There is a great number of restaurants in the area around the university (for more information, the local guide in Section 9 of this handbook can be consulted). There is also a university cafeteria, but participants may not use it because it requires a complicated card system in order for food to be purchased. The quality of food in the restaurants around the university is good and the prices
are very reasonable.
