We propose a new task of extracting event-event relations across documents. We present our efforts at designing an annotation schema and building a corpus for this task. Our schema includes five main types of relations: Inheritance, Expansion, Contingency, Comparison and Temporality, along with 21 subtypes. We also lay out the main challenges based on detailed inter-annotator disagreement and error analysis. We hope these resources can serve as a benchmark to encourage research on this new problem.
