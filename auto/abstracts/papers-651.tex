Character-based and word-based methods are two main types of statistical models for Chinese word segmentation, the former exploiting sequence labeling models over characters and the latter typically exploiting a transition-based model, with the advantages that word-level features can be easily utilized. Neural models have been exploited for character-based Chinese word segmentation, giving high accuracies by making use of external character embeddings, yet requiring less feature engineering. In this paper, we study a neural model for word-based Chinese word segmentation, by replacing the manually-designed discrete features with neural features in a word-based segmentation framework. Experimental results demonstrate that word features lead to comparable performances to the best systems in the literature, and a further combination of discrete and neural features gives top accuracies.
