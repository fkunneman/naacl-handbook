We present in this paper our three system submissions for the POS tagging subtask of the Empirist Shared Task: our baseline system UdS-retrain extends a standard training data set with in-domain training data; UdS-distributional and UdS-surface add two different ways for handling OOV words on top of the baseline system by using either distributional information or a combination of surface similarity and language model information. We reach the best performance by the distributional model.
