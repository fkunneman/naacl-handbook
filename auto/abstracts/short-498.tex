We describe the Iraq Body Count Corpus (IBC-C) dataset, the first substantial armed conflict-related dataset which can be used for conflict analysis. IBC-C provides a ground-truth dataset for conflict specific named entity recognition, slot filling, and event de-duplication. IBC-C is constructed using data collected by the Iraq Body Count project  which has been recording casualties resulting from the ongoing war in Iraq since 2003. We describe the dataset's creation, how it can be used for the above three tasks and provide initial baseline results for the first task (named entity recognition) using Hidden Markov Models, Conditional Random Fields, and Recursive Neural Networks.
