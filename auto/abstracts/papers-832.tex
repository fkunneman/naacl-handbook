Foreign language learners can acquire new vocabulary by using cognate and context clues when reading. We devise an experimental framework to measure such incidental comprehension using Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk). With the data collected, we train a graphical model to jointly predict which words users will be able to comprehend, using features such as edit distance (cognate clues) and pointwise mutual information (context clues). The results show that our model's predictions correlate with learner understanding, enabling the construction of comprehensible text for personalized foreign language education.
