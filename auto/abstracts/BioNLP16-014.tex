This paper evaluates the difference between human pathway curation and current NLP systems. We propose graph analysis methods for quantifying              the gap between human curated pathway maps and the output of state-of-the-art automatic NLP systems. Evaluation is performed on the popular mTOR pathway. Based on analyzing where current systems perform well and where they fail, we identify possible avenues for progress.
