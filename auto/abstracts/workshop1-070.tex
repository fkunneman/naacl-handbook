We present our systems for the WMT{\textasciitilde}2016 shared task on cross-lingual pronoun prediction. The main contribution is a classifier used to determine whether an instance of the ambiguous English pronoun ``it'' functions as an anaphoric, pleonastic or event reference pronoun. For the English-to-French task the classifier is incorporated in an extended baseline, which takes the form of a source-aware language model. An implementation of the source-aware language model is also provided for each of the remaining language pairs.
