The Regesta Imperii (RI) are an important source for research in European-medieval history. Sources spread over many centuries of medieval history ---mainly charters of German-Roman Emporers --- are summarized as ``Regests'' and pooled in the RI. Interesting medieval demographic groups and players are i.a. cities, citizens or spiritual institutions (e.g. bishops or monasteries). Themes of historical interest are i.a. peace and war or the endowment of new privileges. We investigate the RI for important players and themes, applying state-of-the-art text classification methods from computational linguistics. We examine the performance of different classification methods in view of the linguistically very heterogeneous RI, including a Neural Network approach that is designed to capture complex interactions between players and themes.
