We provide a theoretical argument that a common form of projective transition-based dependency parsing is less powerful than constituent parsing using latent variables.  The argument is a proof that, under reasonable assumptions, a transition-based dependency parser can be converted to a latent-variable context-free grammar producing equivalent structures.
