In this paper we present our winning system in the WMT16 Shared Task on Cross- Lingual Pronoun Prediction, where the objective is to predict a missing target language pronoun based on the target and source sentences. Our system is a deep recurrent neural network, which reads both the source language and target language context with a softmax layer making the final prediction. Our system achieves the best macro recall on all four languages. The margin to the next best system ranges between less than 1pp and almost 12pp depending on the language pair.
