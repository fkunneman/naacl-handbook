In this paper, we discuss our endeavors for the Named Entities Workshop (NEWS) 2016 transliteration shared task, where we focus on English to Thai transliteration. The alignment between Thai orthography and phonology is not always monotonous, but few transliteration systems take this into account. In our proposed system, we exploit phonological knowledge to resolve problematic instances where the monotonous alignment assumption breaks down. We achieve a 29\% relative improvement over the baseline system for the NEWS 2016 transliteration shared task.
