We present a named entity recognition (NER) system for tagging fiction: LitNER. Relative to more traditional approaches, litNER has two important properties: (1) it makes use of no hand-tagged data or gazetteers, instead bootstrapping from term clusters; and (2) it leverages multiple instances of the same name in a text. Our experiments show it to substantially outperform off-the-shelf supervised NER systems.
