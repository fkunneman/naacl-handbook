This paper aims at utilizing cognitive information obtained from the eye movements behavior of annotators for automatic co-reference resolution. We first record eye-movement behavior of 14 participants resolving co-references in 22 documents selected from a standard dataset. By inspecting the gaze-regression profiles of our participants, we observe how regressive saccades account for selection of potential antecedents. Based on this observation, we then propose heuristics to utilize gaze data to prune mention-pairs in  mention-pair model, a popular paradigm for automatic co-reference resolution. Significant improvement in accuracy across several classifiers is observed with our heuristics, demonstrating why cognitive data can be useful for a difficult task like co-reference resolution.
