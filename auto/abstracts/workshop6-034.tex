We present a high-level description and error analysis of the Columbia-NYUAD system for morphological reinflection, which builds on previous work on supervised morphological paradigm completion. Our system improved over the shared task baseline on some of the languages, reaching up to 31\% absolute increase.  Our ranking on average was 5th in Track{\textasciitilde}1, 8th in Track{\textasciitilde}2, and 3rd in Track{\textasciitilde}3.
