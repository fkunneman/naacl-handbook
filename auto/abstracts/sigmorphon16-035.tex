The 2016 SIGMORPHON Shared Task was devoted to the problem of morphological reinflection and introduced morphological datasets for 10 languages with diverse typological characteristics. The Shared Task drew submissions from 9 teams representing 11 institutions reflecting a variety of approaches to addressing supervised learning of reinflection.  Systems using recurrent neural network architectures consistently performed best - in fact, there was a significant margin between neural and non-neural approaches.  The best neural approach, on average, outperformed the best non-neural one by 13.76\%; on individual tasks and languages the gap in accuracy sometimes exceeded 60\%. This demonstrates the appropriateness of neural systems for morphological analysis and generation, and serves as encouragement for future shared tasks to continue to explore variants of the problem of morphological reinflection.
