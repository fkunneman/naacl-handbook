Semantic scripts is a conceptual representation which defines how events are organized into higher level activities. Practically all the previous approaches to inducing script knowledge from text relied on count-based techniques (e.g., generative models) and have not attempted to compositionally model events. In this work, we introduce a neural network model which relies on distributed compositional representations of events. The model captures statistical dependencies between events in a scenario, overcomes some of the shortcomings of previous approaches (e.g., by more effectively dealing with data sparsity) and outperforms count-based counterparts on the narrative cloze task.
