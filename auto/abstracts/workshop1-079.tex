Paraphrase can help match synonyms or match phrases with the same or similar meaning, thus it plays an important role in automatic evaluation of machine translation. The traditional approaches extract paraphrase in general domain from bilingual corpus. Because the WMT16 metrics task consists of three sub-tasks, namely news domain, medical domain, and IT domain, we propose to extract domain-specific paraphrase tables from monolingual corpus to replace the general paraphrase table. We utilize the M-L approach to filter the large scale general monolingual corpus into a domain-specific sub-corpus, and exploit Markov Network model to extract paraphrase tables from the sub-corpus. The experimental results on WMT15 Metrics task show that METEOR metric using the domain-specific paraphrase tables outperforms that using the paraphrase table in general domain extracted from the bi-lingual corpus.
