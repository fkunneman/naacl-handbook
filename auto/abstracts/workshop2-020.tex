We present a state-of-the-art algorithm for measuring the semantic similarity of word pairs using novel combinations of word embeddings, WordNet, and the concept dictionary 4lang. We evaluate our system on the SimLex-999 benchmark data. Our top score of 0.755 is higher than any published system that we are aware of, well beyond the average inter-annotator agreement of 0.67, and close to the 0.78 average correlation between a human rater and the average of all other ratings, suggesting that our system has achieved near-human performance on this benchmark.
