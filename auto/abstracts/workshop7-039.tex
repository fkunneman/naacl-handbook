Social scientists and journalists nowadays have to deal with an increasingly large amount of data. It usually requires expensive searching and annotation effort to find insight in a sea of information. Our goal is to build a discourse analysis system which can be applied to large text collections. This system can help social scientists and journalists to analyze data and validate their research theories by providing them with tailored machine learning methods to alleviate the annotation effort and exploratory facilities and visualization tools. We report initial experimental results in a case study related to discourse analysis in political debates.
