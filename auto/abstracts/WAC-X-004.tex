In this paper we describe SoMaJo, a rule-based tokenizer for German web and social media texts that was the best-performing system in the EmpiriST 2015 shared task with an average \$F\_1\$-score of 99.57. We give an overview of the system and the phenomena its rules cover, as well as a detailed error analysis. The tokenizer is available as free software.
