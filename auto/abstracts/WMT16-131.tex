We describe the design, the evaluation setup, and the results of the 2016 WMT shared task on cross-lingual pronoun prediction. This is a classification task in which participants are asked to provide predictions on what pronoun class label should replace a placeholder value in the target-language text, provided in lemmatised and PoS-tagged form. We provided four subtasks, for the English---French and English---German language pairs, in both directions. Eleven teams participated in the shared task; nine for the English---French subtask, five for French---English, nine for English---German, and six for German---English. Most of the submissions outperformed two strong language-model-based baseline systems, with systems using deep recurrent neural networks outperforming those using other architectures for most language pairs.
