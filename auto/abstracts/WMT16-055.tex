In this paper we present the system developed at the IXA NLP Group of the University of the Basque Country for the Biomedical Translation Task in the First Conference on Machine Translation (WMT16). For the adaptation of a statistical machine translation system to the biomedical domain, we developed three approaches based on a baseline system for English-Spanish and Spanish-English language pairs. The lack of terminology and the variation of the prominent sense of the words are the issues we have addressed on these approaches. The best of our systems reached the average of all the systems submitted in the challenge in most of the evaluation sets.
