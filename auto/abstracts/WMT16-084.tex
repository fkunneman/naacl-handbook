This paper presents the description of 12 systems  submitted to the WMT16 IT-task, covering six different languages, namely Basque, Bulgarian, Dutch, Czech, Portuguese and Spanish. All these systems were developed under the scope of the QTLeap project, presenting a common strategy. For each language two different systems were submitted, namely a phrase-based MT system built using Moses, and a system exploiting deep language engineering approaches, that in all the languages but Bulgarian was implemented using TectoMT. For 4 of the 6 languages, the TectoMT-based system performs better than the Moses-based one.
