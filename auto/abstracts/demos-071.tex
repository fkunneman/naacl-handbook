In this paper, we present Roleo, a web tool for visualizing the vector spaces generated by the evaluation of distributional memory (DM) models over thematic fit judgements.  A thematic fit judgement is a rating of the selectional preference of a verb for an argument that fills a given thematic role.  The DM approach to thematic fit judgements involves the construction of a sub-space in which a prototypical role-filler can be built for comparison to the noun being judged.  We describe a publicly-accessible web tool that allows for querying and exploring these spaces as well as a technique for visualizing thematic fit sub-spaces efficiently for web use.
