This paper presents an algorithm for automatic word forms inflection. We use the method of longest common subsequence to extract abstract paradigms from given pairs of basic and inflected word forms, as well as suffix and prefix features to predict this paradigm automatically. We elaborate this algorithm using combination of affix feature-based and character ngram models, which substantially enhances performance especially for the languages possessing nonlocal phenomena such as vowel harmony. Our system took part in SIGMORPHON 2016 Shared Task and took third place in 17 of 30 subtasks and fourth place in 7 substasks among 7 participants.
