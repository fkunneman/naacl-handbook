This paper provides an overview of the PROMT submissions for the WMT16 Shared Translation Tasks. We participated in seven language pairs with three different system configurations (rule-based, statistical and hybrid). We describe the architecture of the three configurations. We show that fast and accurate customization of the rule-based system can increase the BLEU scores significantly.
