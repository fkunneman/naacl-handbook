The cross-lingual pronoun prediction task at WMT 2016 requires to restore the missing target pronouns  from source text and target lemmatized and POS-tagged translations.  We propose to use a specific Language Model, which captures the likelihood of a pronoun given the gender and number of its preceding (pro)nouns, to select the best candidate in English-to-French subtask. Besides, we apply some heuristics on pronouns of less dependence on their antecedent's gender and number, which are specifically based on French and English grammars.
