In unsupervised semantic role labeling, identifying the role of an argument is usually informed by its dependency relation with the predicate. In this work, we propose a neural model to learn argument embeddings from the context by explicitly incorporating dependency relations as multiplicative factors, which bias argument embeddings according to their dependency roles. Our model outperforms existing state-of-the-art embeddings in unsupervised semantic role induction on the CoNLL 2008 dataset. Qualitative results demonstrate our model can effectively bias argument embeddings based on their dependency role.
