We participated in the Bilingual Document Alignment shared task of WMT 2016 with the intent of testing plain cross-lingual information retrieval platform built on top of the Apache Lucene framework. We devised a number of interesting variants, including one that only considers the URLs of the pages, and that offers --- without any heuristic ---  surprisingly high performances. We finally submitted the output of a system that combines two informations (TEXT and URL) from documents and a post-treatment for an accuracy that reaches 92\% on the development dataset distributed for the shared task.
