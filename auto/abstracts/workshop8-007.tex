Explicit representations of images are useful for linguistic applications related to imaages. We design a representation based on first-order models that capture the objects present in an image as well as their spatial relations. We take a supervised learning approach to the spatial relation classification problem and study the effects of spatial and lexical information on prediction performance. We find that lexical information is required to accurately predict spatial relations when combined with location information, achieving an F-score of 0.80 (compared to a most-frequent-class baseline of 0.62).
