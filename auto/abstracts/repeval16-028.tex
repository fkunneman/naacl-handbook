Multi-sense word embeddings (MSEs) model different meanings of word forms with different vectors. We propose two new methods for evaluating MSEs, one based on monolingual dictionaries, and the other exploiting the principle that words may be ambiguous as far as the postulated senses translate to different words in some other language
