This paper presents FrameNet's approach to the representation of Support Verbs, as one type of multiword expression (MWE) included in the database. In addition to motivating and illustrating FrameNet's newly consistent annotation practice for Support Verb constructions, this work advocates adopting a broad view of what constitutes a multiword expression.
