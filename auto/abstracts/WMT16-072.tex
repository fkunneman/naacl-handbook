This paper presents an automatic post-editing (APE) method to improve the translation quality produced by an English--German (EN--DE) statistical machine translation (SMT) system. Our system is based on Operation Sequential Model (OSM) combined with phrased-based statistical MT (PB-SMT) system. The system is trained on monolingual settings between MT outputs (\$TL\_{MT}\$) produced by a black-box MT system and their corresponding post-edited version (\$TL\_{PE}\$). Our system achieves considerable improvement over \$TL\_{MT}\$ on a held-out development set. The reported system achieves 64.10 BLEU (1.99 absolute points and 3.2\% relative improvement in BLEU over raw MT output) and 24.14 TER  and a TER score of 24.14 (0.66 absolute points and 0.25\% relative improvement in TER over raw MT output) in the official test set.
