This paper outlines the UU-SVM system for Task 1 of the WMT16 Shared Task in Quality Estimation. Our system uses Sup- port Vector Machine Regression to investi- gate the impact of a series of features aim- ing to convey translation quality. We pro- pose novel features measuring reordering and noun translation errors. We show that we can outperform the baseline when we combine it with a subset of our new fea- tures.
