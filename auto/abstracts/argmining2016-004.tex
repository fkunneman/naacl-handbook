Topic-independent expressions for conveying agreement and disagreement were annotated in a corpus of web forum debates, in order to evaluate a classifier trained to detect these two categories.  Among the 175              expressions annotated in the evaluation set, 163 were unique, which shows that there is large variation in expressions used. This variation might be one of the reasons why the task of automatically detecting the categories was difficult. F-scores of 0.44 and 0.37 were achieved by a classifier trained on 2,000 debate sentences for detecting sentence-level agreement and disagreement.
