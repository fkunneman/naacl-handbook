We describe the TÜBİTAK Turkish-English machine translation systems submissions in both directions for the WMT 2016: News Translation Task. We experiment with phrase-based and hierarchical phrase-based systems for both directions using word-level and morpheme-level representations for the Turkish side. Finally we perform system combination which results in 0.5 BLEU increase for Turkish-to-English and 0.3 BLEU increase for English-to-Turkish.
