This paper describes the hierarchical phrase-based machine translation system built jointly by the University of Edinburgh and the University of Munich (LMU) for the shared translation task at the ACL{\textasciitilde}2016 First Conference on Machine Translation (WMT16). The WMT16 Edinburgh/LMU system was trained for translation of news domain texts from English into Romanian. We participated in the shared task for machine translation of news under ``constrained'' conditions, i.e. using the provided training data only.
