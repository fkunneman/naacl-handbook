We introduce GoWvis, an interactive web application that represents any piece of text inputted by the user as a graph-of-words and leverages graph degeneracy and community detection to generate an extractive summary (keyphrases and sentences) of the inputted text in an unsupervised fashion. The entire analysis can be fully customized via the tuning of many text preprocessing, graph building, and graph mining parameters. Our system is thus well suited to educational purposes, exploration and early research experiments. The new summarization strategy we propose also shows promise.
