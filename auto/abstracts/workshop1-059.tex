This paper describes the joint submission of the QT21 and HimL projects for the English-Romanian translation task of the ACL 2016 First Conference on Machine Translation (WMT 2016). The submission is a system combination which combines twelve different statistical machine translation systems provided by the different groups (RWTH Aachen University, LMU Munich, Charles University in Prague, University of Edinburgh, University of Sheffield, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, LIMSI, University of Amsterdam, Tilde). The systems are combined using RWTH's system combination approach. The final submission shows an improvement of 1.0 \BLEU compared to the best single system on newstest2016.
