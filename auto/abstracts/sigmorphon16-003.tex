Three popular vocal-tract animation paradigms were tested for intelligibility when displaying videos of pre-recorded Electromagnetic Articulography (EMA) data in an online experiment. EMA tracks the position of sensors attached to the tongue. The conditions were dots with tails (where only the coil location is presented), 2D animation (where the dots are connected to form 2D representations of the lips, tongue surface and chin), and a 3D model with coil locations driving facial and tongue rigs. The 2D animation (recorded in VisArtico) showed the highest identification of the prompts.
