We propose a brand new ``Liberal'' Event Extraction paradigm to extract events and discover event schemas from any input corpus simultaneously. We incorporate symbolic (e.g., Abstract Meaning Representation) and distributional semantics to detect and represent event structures and adopt a joint typing framework to simultaneously extract event types and argument roles and discover an event schema. Experiments on general and specific domains demonstrate that this framework can construct high-quality schemas with many event and argument role types, covering a high proportion of event types and argument roles in manually defined schemas. We show that extraction performance using discovered schemas is comparable to supervised models trained from a large amount of data labeled according to pre-defined event types. The extraction quality of new event types is also promising.
