Evidences that support a claim ``a subject phrase promotes or suppresses a value'' help in making a rational decision. We aim to construct a model that can classify if a particular evidence supports a claim of a promoting/suppressing relationship given an arbitrary subject-value pair. In this paper, we propose a recurrent neural network (RNN) with an attention model to classify such evidences. We incorporated a word embedding technique in an attention model such that our method generalizes for never-encountered subjects and value phrases. Benchmarks showed that the method outperforms conventional methods in evidence classification tasks.
