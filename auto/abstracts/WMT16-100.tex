This paper describes the TALP---UPC system in the Spanish---English WMT 2016 biomedical shared task. Our system is a standard phrase-based system enhanced with vocabulary expansion using bilingual word embeddings and a characterbased neural language model with rescoring. The former focuses on resolving out-of-vocabulary words, while the latter enhances the fluency of the system. The two modules progressively improve the final translation as measured by a combination of several lexical metrics.
