The WMT Bilingual Document Alignment Task requires systems to assign source pages to their ``translations'', in a big space of possible pairs. We present four methods: The first one uses the overlap in certain tokens and their order in candidate document pairs. The second method requires translated versions of the target text, and matches them with the candidates. The third and fourth methods try to overcome some of the challenges presented by the nature of the corpus, by considering the string similarity of source URL and candidate URL, and combining the first two approaches.
