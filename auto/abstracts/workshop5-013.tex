In this study, we model the causal links between the complexities of different macroscopic aspects of child language. We consider pairs of sequences of measurements of the quantity and diversity of the lexical and grammatical properties. Each pair of sequences is taken as the trajectory of a high-dimensional dynamical system, some of whose dimensions are unknown. We use Multispatial Convergent Cross Mapping to ascertain the directions of causality between the pairs of sequences. Our results provide support for the hypothesis that  children learn grammar through distributional learning, where the generalization of smaller structures enables generalizations at higher levels, consistent with the proposals of construction-based approaches to language.
