Speed of access is a very important property for phrase tables in phrase based statistical machine translation as they are queried many times per sentence. In this paper we present a new standalone phrase table, optimized for query speed and memory locality. The phrase table is cache free and can optionally incorporate a reordering table within. We are able to achieve two times faster decoding by using our phrase table in the Moses decoder in place of the current state-of-the-art phrase table solution without sacrificing translation quality. Using a new, experimental version of Moses we are able to achieve 10 times faster decoding using our novel phrase table.
