In this paper we present the results of the University of Sheffield (SHEF) submissions for the WMT16 shared task on document-level Quality Estimation (task 3). Our submission explored discourse and document-aware information and word embeddings as features. SVR and Gaussian Process were used to train the Quality Estimation models. Results show that discourse features do not improve over baseline results. On the other hand, the use of word embeddings (combined with baseline features) and a Gaussian Process model with two kernels led to the best system of the task (0.391 of Pearson r).
