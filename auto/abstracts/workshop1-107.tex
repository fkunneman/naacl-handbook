The vast majority of Machine Translation (MT) evaluation approaches are based on the idea that the closer the MT output is to a human reference translation, the higher its quality. While translation quality has two important aspects, adequacy and fluency, the existing reference-based metrics are largely focused on the former. In this work we combine our metric UPF-Cobalt, originally presented at the WMT15 Metrics Task, with a number of features intended to capture translation fluency. Experiments show that the integration of fluency-oriented features significantly improves the results, rivalling the best-performing evaluation metrics on the WMT15  data.
