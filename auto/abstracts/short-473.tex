Retrieving similar short texts is crucial to many applications, e.g., web search, microblogging, ads matching, and so forth. Most of the traditional methods concentrate on how to improve the precision of the similarity measurement, while current real applications need to efficiently explore the top similar short texts semantically related to the query one. In this paper, we address the efficiency issue by investigating the similarity strategies and incorporating them into the FAST framework (efficient FrAmework for semantic similar Short Texts retrieval). We conduct comprehensive performance evaluation on real-life data which shows that our proposal outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques.
