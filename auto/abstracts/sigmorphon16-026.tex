This paper presents a proposal for learning morphological inflections by a grapheme-to-phoneme learning model. No special processing is used for specific languages. The starting point has been our previous research on induction of phonology and morphology for normalization of historical texts. The results show that a very simple method can indeed improve upon some baselines, but does not overcome the best systems in the task.
