Context is crucial for identifying argumentative relations in text, but many argument mining methods make little use of contextual features. This paper presents context-aware argumentative relation mining that uses features extracted from writing topics as well as from windows of context sentences. Experiments on student essays demonstrate that the proposed features improve predictive performance in two argumentative relation classification tasks.
