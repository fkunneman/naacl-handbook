Boulder Learning has developed and evaluated a conversational multimedia virtual tutor for elementary school science. The operating principles for the tutor are grounded on research from education and cognitive science. This virtual science tutor is unique in that it engages children in spoken dialogs in which they learn to construct explanations of science phenomena presented in illustrations, animations and interactive simulations. Summative evaluations indicate that students are highly engaged in the tutoring sessions, and achieve learning outcomes equivalent to expert human tutors. Tutorials are developed through a process of recording and annotating data from sessions with students, and then updating tutor models. In initial evaluations, My Science Tutor (MyST) has been shown to produce significant learning gains with effect size d=0.53 compared to controls. It is enthusiastically supported by students and teachers. Teachers report that it is feasible to integrate into their curriculum.
