This paper presents the conversion of SynTagRus dependency structures (DS) into English Penn Treebank style phrase structures (PS), whose resulting data will be used to train a statistical PS parser for Russian and create a large-scale PS-parsed corpus. The implemented DS-to-PS conversion includes various innovative features in order to create PS trees that are closest to Penn Treebank style while optimally preserving information present in the original DS annotations. We believe that the newly converted PS treebank will be not only an adequate training dataset for our ongoing project but also a valuable resource for traditional and computational linguistic research.
