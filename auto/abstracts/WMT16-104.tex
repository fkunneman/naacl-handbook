We describe University of Sheffield's submission to the word-level Quality Estimation shared task. Our system is based on imitation learning, an approach to structured prediction which relies on a classifier and artificially generated data. Compared to other traditional algorithms for the same problem, it allows the use of arbitrary information from previous tag predictions and the use of non-decomposable losses over the structure. We explore these two concepts in our submission while using the baseline features provided by the shared task organizers. Our system outperformed the baseline, even though it uses the same feature set.
