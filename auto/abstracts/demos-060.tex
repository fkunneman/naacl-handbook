The MUSEEC (MUltilingual SEntence Extraction and Compression) summarization tool implements several extractive summarization techniques --- at the level of complete and compressed sentences --- that can be applied, with some minor adaptations, to documents in multiple languages. The current version of MUSEEC provides the following summarization methods: (1) MUSE --- a supervised summarizer, based on a genetic algorithm (GA), that ranks document sentences and extracts top---ranking sentences into a summary, (2) POLY --- an unsupervised summarizer, based on linear programming (LP), that selects the best extract of document sentences, and (3) WECOM --- an unsupervised extension of POLY that compiles a document summary from compressed sentences. In this paper, we provide an overview of MUSEEC methods and its architecture in general.
