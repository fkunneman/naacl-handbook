We present a system submitted to the WMT16 shared task in cross-lingual pronoun prediction, in particular, to the English-to-German and German-to-English sub-tasks. The system is based on a linear classifier making use of features both from the target language model and from linguistically analyzed source and target texts. Furthermore, we apply example weighing in classifier learning, which proved to be beneficial for recall in less frequent pronoun classes. Compared to other shared task participants, our best English-to-German system is able to rank just below the top performing submissions.
