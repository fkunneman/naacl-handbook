We describe the implementation of a Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) tool in a Dutch Text-to-Pictograph translation system, which converts textual messages into sequences of pictographic images. The system is used in an online platform for Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC). In the original translation process, the appropriate sense of a word was not disambiguated before converting it into a pictograph. This often resulted in incorrect translations. The implementation of a WSD tool provides a better semantic understanding of the textual input messages.
