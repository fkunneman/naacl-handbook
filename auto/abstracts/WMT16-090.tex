This paper presents an overview of the system submitted by the University of Hamburg to the IT domain shared translation task as part of the ACL 2016 First Conference of Machine Translation (WMT 2016). We have chosen data selection as a domain adaptation method. The filtering of the general  domain data makes use of paragraph vectors as a novel approach for scoring the sentences. Experiments were conducted for English-German under the constrained condition.
