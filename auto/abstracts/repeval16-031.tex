While there has been a growing body of work on word embeddings, and recent directions better reflect sense-level representations, evaluation remains a challenge. We propose a method of query inventory generation for embedding evaluation that recasts the principle of subsumption preservation, a desirable property of semantic graph-based similarity measures, as a comparative similarity measure as applied to existing lexical resources. We aim that this method is immediately applied to populate query inventories and perform evaluation with the ordered triple-based approach set forth, and inspires future refinements to existing notions of evaluating sense-directed embeddings.
