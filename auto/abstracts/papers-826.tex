Modeling relation paths has been shown to offer significant gains in embedding models for knowledge base (KB) completion. However, enumerating paths between two entities is very expensive, and existing approaches typically resort to an approximation using a sampled subset. This problem is particularly acute when text is jointly modeled with KB relations and used to provide direct evidence for facts mentioned in it. In this paper, we propose the first exact dynamic programming algorithm which enables efficient incorporation of all multi-step relation paths of bounded length, while also modeling both relation types and intermediate nodes in the compositional path representations. We conduct a theoretical analysis on the efficiency gain from such an approach. Experiments on biomedical domain show that it addresses representational limitations in prior approaches and improves accuracy in KB completion.
