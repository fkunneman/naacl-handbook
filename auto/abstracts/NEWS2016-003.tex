Transliteration is the phonetic translation between two different languages. There are many works that approach transliteration using machine translation methods. This paper describes the official baseline system for the NEWS 2016 workshop shared task. This baseline is based on a standard phrase-based machine translation system using Moses. Results are between the range of best and worst from last year's workshops providing a nice starting point for participants this year.
