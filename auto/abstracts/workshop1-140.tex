In this paper, we address the task of automatically aligning/detecting the bilingual documents that are translations of each other from a single web-domain as part of WMT 2016. 1 Given the large amounts of data available in each web-domain, a brute force approach like finding similarities between every possible pair is a computationally expensive operation. Therefore, we start with a simple approach on matching just the web page urls after some pre-processing to reduce the number of possible pairings to a small extent. This simple approach obtained a recall of 50\% and the exact matches from this approach are removed from further consideration. We built on top of this using an n-gram based approach that uses the partial English translations of French web pages and achieved a recall of 93.71\% on the training pairs provided. We also outline an IR-based approach that uses both content and the meta data of each web page url, thereby obtaining a recall of 56.31\%. Our final submission to this shared task using n-gram based approach achieved a recall of 93.92\%.
