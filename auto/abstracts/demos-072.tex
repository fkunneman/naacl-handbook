We present a robust and efficient parallelizable multilingual UIMA-based platform for automatically annotating textual inputs with different layers of linguistic description, ranging from surface level phenomena all the way to deep discourse-level information. In particular, given an input text, the pipeline extracts: a) sentences and tokens, b) entity mentions (named entities, nominals, personal pronouns), c) syntactic information (constituency and dependency trees), d) opinionated expressions, e) relations between entity mentions, f) co-reference chains and g) wikified entities. The system is available in two versions: a standalone distribution enables design and optimization of user-specific sub-modules, whereas a server-client distribution allows for straightforward high-performance NLP processing, reducing the engineering cost for higher-level tasks.
