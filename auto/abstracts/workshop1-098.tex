This paper describes our systems for Task 1 of the WMT15 Shared Task on Quality Estimation. Our submissions use (i) a continuous space language model (CSLM) to extract sentence embeddings and cross-entropy scores, (ii) a neural network machine translation (NMT) model, (iii) a set of QuEst features (iv) a combination of features produced by QuEst and the features produced with CSLM and NMT. Our primary submission achieved third position on official scoring task and second spot on ranking task. Another interesting finding is the good performance  obtained only using CSLM sentence embeddings as features  that are learned in an unsupervised fashion without any additional hand-crafted features.
