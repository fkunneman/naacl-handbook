Event extraction is a particularly challenging task of information extraction, which intend to identify and classify event trigger and arguments from raw text. In recent works, when deciding the event types (trigger classification), most of the works are either pattern-only  or feature-only. However, although patterns cannot cover all representations of an event, it is still a very important feature. In addition, when identifying and classifying arguments, previous works consider each candidate argument separately while ignoring the relation between arguments. In this paper, we propose Regularization-Based Pattern Balancing Method (RBPB). Inspired by the progress in representation learning, we use trigger embedding, sentence-level embedding and pattern features together as our features for trigger classification. So that the effect of patterns and other useful features can be balanced. In addition, RBPB use regularization method to take advantage of the relation between arguments. Experiments show that we achieved a rather good result than the current state-of-art work. We will release our code later.
