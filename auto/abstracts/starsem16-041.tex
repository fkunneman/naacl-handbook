Recent models in distributional semantics consider derivational patterns (e.g., use -> use + ful ) as the result of a compositional process, where base term and affix are combined. We exploit such models for German particle verbs (PVs), and focus on the task of learning a mapping function between base verbs and particle verbs. Our models apply particle-verb motivated training-space restrictions relying on nearest neighbors, as well as recent advances from zero-shot-learning. The models improve the mapping between base terms and derived terms for a new PV derivation dataset, and also across existing derivation datasets for German and English.
