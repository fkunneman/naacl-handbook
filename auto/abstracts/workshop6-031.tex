This work examines CRF-based sequence alignment models for learning natural language morphology. Although these systems have performed well for a limited number of languages, this work, as part of the SigMorPhon 2016 shared task, specifically sets out to determine whether these models handle non-concatenative morphology as well as previous work might suggest. Results, however, indicate a strong preference for simpler, concatenative morphological systems.
