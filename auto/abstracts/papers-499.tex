Automatic negation scope detection is a task that has been tackled using different classifiers and heuristics. Most systems are however 1) highly-engineered, 2) English-specific, and 3) only tested on the same genre they were trained on. We start by addressing 1) and 2) using a neural network architecture. Results obtained on data from the *SEM2012 shared task on negation scope detection show that even a simple feed-forward neural network using word-embedding features alone, performs on par with earlier classifiers, with a bi-directional LSTM outperforming all of them. We then address 3) by means of a specially-designed synthetic test set; in doing so, we explore the problem of detecting the negation scope more in depth and show that performance suffers from genre effects and differs with the type of negation considered.
