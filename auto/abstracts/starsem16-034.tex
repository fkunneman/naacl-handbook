A difficult task when generating text from  knowledge bases (KB) consists in finding appropriate lexicalisations for KB symbols. We present an approach for lexicalising knowledge base relations and apply it to DBPedia data. Our model learns low-dimensional embeddings of words and RDF resources and uses these representations to score RDF properties against candidate lexicalisations. Training our model using (i) pairs of RDF triples and automatically generated verbalisations of these triples and (ii) pairs of paraphrases extracted from various resources, yields competitive results on DBPedia data.
