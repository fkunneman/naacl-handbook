This paper summarises the contributions of the teams at the University of Helsinki, Uppsala University and the University of Turku to the news translation tasks for translating from and to Finnish. Our models address the problem of treating morphology and data coverage in various ways. We introduce a new efficient tool for word alignment and discuss factorisations, gappy language models and re-inflection techniques for generating proper Finnish output. The results demonstrate once again that training data is the most effective way to increase translation performance.
