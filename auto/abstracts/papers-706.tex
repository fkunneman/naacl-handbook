How much is 131 million US dollars? To help readers put such numbers in context, we propose a new task of automatically generating short descriptions known as perspectives, e.g. ``\$131 million is about the cost to employ everyone in Texas over a lunch period''. First, we collect a new dataset of numeric mentions from news articles paired with ratings of generated perspectives using crowdsourcing. We then propose a system to generate these descriptions consisting of two steps: formula construction and description generation. In construction, we compose formulae from numeric facts in a knowledge base and rank the resulting formulas based on familiarity, numeric proximity and semantic compatibility. In generation, we convert a formula into natural language using a sequence-to-sequence neural network model. Our system has a 15.2\% F1 improvement over a non-compositional baseline at formula construction and a 12.5 BLEU point improvement over a baseline at description generation.
