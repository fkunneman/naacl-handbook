We describe the submissions of USFD team to the phrase-level QE shared task at the WMT-16. We test two different approaches to phrase-level QE: we enrich the provided set of baseline features with the information about contexts, and predict phrase-level scores using predictions of other levels. These approaches show to perform closely in terms of multiplication of F1-scores (primary metric), although F1-score for the individual classes differ.
