We describe the neural machine translation system of New York University (NYU) and University of Montreal (MILA) for the translation tasks of WMT'16. The main goal of NYU-MILA submission to WMT'16 is to evaluate a new character-level decoding approach in neural machine translation on various language pairs. The proposed neural machine translation system is an attention-based encoder---decoder with a subword-level en- coder and a character-level decoder. The decoder of the neural machine translation system does not require explicit segmentation, when characters are used as to- kens. The character-level decoding approach provides benefits especially when translating a source language into other morphologically rich languages.
