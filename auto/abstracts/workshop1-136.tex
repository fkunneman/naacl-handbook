This paper presents the results of the WMT16 Tuning Shared Task. We provided the participants of this task with a complete machine translation system and asked them to tune its internal parameters (feature weights). The tuned systems were used to translate the test set and the outputs were manually ranked for translation quality. We received 4 submissions in the Czech-English and 8 in the English-Czech translation direction. In addition, we ran 2 baseline setups, tuning the parameters with standard optimizers for BLEU score.
