Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) is an annotation framework in which the meaning of a full sentence is represented as a rooted, acyclic, directed graph. In this paper, we describe a  project in which we develop specifications for the annotation of a Chinese AMR corpus: the Chinese translation of the Little Prince. The inter-agreement smatch score between the two annotators is 0.83. We also propose to integrate alignment into Chinese AMR annotation.
