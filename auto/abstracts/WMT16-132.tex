This paper introduces and summarises the findings of a new shared task at the intersection of Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision: the generation of image descriptions in a target language, given an image and/or one or more descriptions in a different (source) language. This challenge was organised along with the Conference on Machine Translation (WMT16), and called for system submissions for two task variants: (i) a translation task, in which a source language image description needs to be translated to a target language, (optionally) with additional cues from the corresponding image, and (ii) a description generation task, in which a target language description needs to be generated for an image, (optionally) with additional cues from source language descriptions of the same image. In this first edition of the shared task, 16 systems were submitted for the translation task and seven for the image description task, from a total of 10 teams.
