In this paper, I present a specialized open-source crawler that can be used to obtain bias-reduced samples from the web. First, I briefly discuss the relevance of bias-reduced web corpus sampling for corpus linguistics. Then, I summarize theoretical results that show how commonly used crawling methods obtain highly biased samples from the web. The theoretical part of the paper is followed by a description my feature-complete and stable ClaraX crawler which performs so-called Random Walks, a form of crawling that allows for bias-reduced sampling if combined with methods of post-crawl rejection sampling. Finally, results from two large crawling experiments in the German web are reported. I show that bias reduction is feasible if certain technical and practical hurdles are overcome.
