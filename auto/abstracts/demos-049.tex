MeTA is developed to unite machine learning, information retrieval, and natural language processing in one easy-to-use toolkit. Its focus on indexing allows it to perform well on large datasets, supporting online classification and other out-of-core algorithms. MeTAs liberal open source license encourages contributions, and its extensive online documentation, forum, and tutorials make this process straightforward. We run experiments and show MeTA's performance is competitive with or better than existing software.
