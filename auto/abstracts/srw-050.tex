This paper proposes a new unsupervised technique for clustering a collection of documents written by distinct individuals into authorial components. We highlight the importance of utilizing syntactic structure to cluster documents by author, and demonstrate experimental results that show the method we outline performs on par with state-of-the-art techniques. Additionally, we argue that this feature set outperforms previous methods in cases where authors consciously emulate each other's style or are otherwise rhetorically similar.
