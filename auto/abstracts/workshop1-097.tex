In this paper, we present the KIT system as well as the KIT-LIMSI system for the ACL 2016 First Conference on Machine Translation. We participated in the shared task Machine Translation of News and submitted translation systems for three different directions: English\$\rightarrow\$German, German\$\rightarrow\$English and English\$\rightarrow\$Romanian. We used a phrase-based machine translation system and investigated several models to rescore the system. We used neural network language and translation models. Using these models, we could improve the translation performance in all tasks.
