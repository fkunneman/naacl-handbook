Dynamic oracle training has shown sub- stantial improvements for dependency parsing in various settings, but has not been explored for constituent parsing. The present article introduces a dynamic ora- cle for transition-based constituent pars- ing. Experiments on the 9 languages of the SPMRL dataset show that a neu- ral greedy parser with morphological fea- tures, trained with a dynamic oracle, leads to accuracies comparable with the best non-reranking and non-ensemble parsers.
