Universal Dependencies (UD) are gaining much attention of late, for systematic evaluation of cross-lingual techniques for cross-lingual dependency parsing. In this paper we present our work in line with UD. Our contribution to this, is manifold. We extend UD to Indian languages through translation of Paninian Dependencies to UD for Hindi Dependency Treebank (HDTB). We discuss the differences in annotation in both the schemes, present parsing experiments for both the formalisms and empirically evaluate their weaknesses and strengths for Hindi. We produce an automatically converted Hindi Treebank conforming to the international standard UD scheme, making it useful as a resource for multilingual language technology.
