We build parallel feature decay algorithms (ParFDA) Moses statistical machine translation (SMT) systems for English to target translation directions in the translation task at the first conference on statistical machine translation{\textasciitilde}\cite{WMT2016} (WMT16). ParFDA obtains results close to the top constrained phrase-based SMT with an average of 2.99 BLEU points difference using significantly less computation for building SMT systems than the computation that would be spent using all available corpora.
