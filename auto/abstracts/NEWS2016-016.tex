This report presents the results from the Ma-chine Transliteration Shared Task conducted as part of The Sixth Named Entities Workshop (NEWS 2016) held at ACL 2016in Berlin, Germany. Similar to previous editions of NEWS Workshop, the Shared Task featured machine transliteration of proper names over 14 different language pairs, including 12 dif-ferent languages and two different Japanese scripts.A total of 5 teams participated in the evaluation, submitting 255 standard and 19 non-standard runs, involving a diverse variety of transliteration methodologies. Four perfor-mance metrics were used to report the evalua-tion results. Once again, the NEWS shared task on machine transliteration has successful-ly achieved its objectives by providing a common ground for the research community to conduct comparative evaluations of state-of-the-art technologies that will benefit the future research and development in this area.
