We are presenting a hybrid MT approach to the WMT2016 Shared Translation Task for the IT-Domain. Our work consists of several translation components based on rule-based and statistical approaches that feed into an informed selection mechanism. Additions to last year's submission include a WSD component, a statistically-enhanced component and several improvements to the rule-based component, relevant to the particular domain. We also present detailed human evaluation on the output of all translation components, focusing on particular systematic errors.
