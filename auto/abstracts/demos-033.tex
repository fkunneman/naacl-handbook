We dis- cuss the design, implementation and appli- cation of pigeo, and empirically evaluate it. pigeo is able to geolocate informal text and is a very useful tool for users who require a free and easy-to-use, yet accurate geolocation service based on pre-trained models. Additionally, users can train their own models easily using pigeo's API.
