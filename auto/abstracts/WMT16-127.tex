This paper describes the submission of Johns Hopkins University for the shared translation task of ACL 2016 First Conference on Machine Translation (WMT 2016). We set up phrase-based, hierarchical phrase-based and syntax-based systems for all 12 language pairs of this year's evaluation campaign. Novel research directions we investigated include: neural probabilistic language models, bilingual neural network language models, morphological segmentation, and the attention-based neural machine translation model as reranking feature.
