This paper provides an overview of the Sheffield University submission to the English-Romanian Translation Task of the ACL 2016 First Conference on Machine Translation (WMT 2016). The submitted translations were produced with a phrase-based system trained with the Moses decoder. As part of our contribution to the system combination for the QT21 joint submission, we investigated n-best rescoring using additional Quality Estimation features. We also experimented with a weighted ranking optimisation approach derived from the PRO algorithm, as a secondary submission.
