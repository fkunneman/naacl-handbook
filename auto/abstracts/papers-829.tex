In this paper, with the help of knowledge base, we build and formulate a semantic space to connect the source and target languages, and apply it to the sequence-to-sequence framework to propose a Knowledge-Based Semantic Embedding (KBSE) method. In our KBSE method, the source sentence is firstly mapped into a knowledge based semantic space, and the target sentence is generated using a recurrent neural network with the internal meaning preserved.  Experiments are conducted on two translation tasks, the electric business data and movie data, and the results show that our proposed method can achieve outstanding performance, compared with both the traditional SMT method and the existing encoder-decoder model.
