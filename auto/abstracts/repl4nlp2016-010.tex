This paper introduces a parameterization for word embeddings produced by the Random Indexing framework. The parameterization introduces position specific weights in the context windows, and the approach is shown to improve the performance in both word similarity and sentiment classification tasks. We also demonstrate the relation between Random Indexing and Convolutional Neural Networks.
