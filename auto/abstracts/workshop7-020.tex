Our research aims at tracking the semantic evolution of the lexicon over time. For this purpose, we investigated two well-known training protocols for neural language models in a synchronic experiment and encountered several problems relating to accuracy and reliability. We were able to identify critical parameters for improving the underlying protocols in order to generate more adequate diachronic language models.
