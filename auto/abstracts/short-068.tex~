We decompose a standard embedding space into interpretable orthogonal subspaces, including a one-dimensional polarity subspace as well as concreteness, frequency and part-of-speech (POS) subspaces. We introduce a new calculus for subspaces that supports operations like ``−1 × hate = love'' and ``give me a neutral word for greasy'' (i.e., oleaginous). This calculus extends analogy computations like ``king − man + woman = queen''. For the tasks of Antonym Classification and POS Tagging our method outperforms the state of the art. We create new test sets for Morphological Analogies and for the task of Polarity Spectrum Creation.
