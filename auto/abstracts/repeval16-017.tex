In this proposal track paper, we have proposed a crowdsourcing based word embedding evaluation technique that will be reliable (unambiguous) and linguistically justified. The method is designed for intrinsic evaluation and is inspired by the proposed method in (Schnabel et al.,2015). We have recognised a methodological shortcoming of the approach provided in that paper, and proposed an improved evaluation techniques that will capture better word relatedness based on context.
