In this paper we look at the question of how to create good automatic meth- ods for generating descriptions of spatial relationships between objects in images. In particular, we investigate the impact of varying different aspects of automatic method development, including using dif- ferent preposition sets, models and feature sets. We find that optimising the preposi- tion set improves previous best Accuracy from 46.2 to 50.2. Feature set optimisa- tion further improves best Accuracy from 50.2 to 53.25. Naive Bayes models out- perform SVMs and decision trees under all conditions tested. The utility of individual features depends on the model used, but the most useful features tend to capture a property pertaining to both objects jointly.
