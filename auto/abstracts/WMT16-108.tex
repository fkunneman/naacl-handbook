We describe the English-Turkish and Turkish-English translation systems submitted by Yandex School of Data Analysis team to WMT16 news translation task. We successfully applied hand-crafted morphological (de-)segmentation of Turkish, syntax-based pre-ordering of English in English-Turkish and post-ordering of English in Turkish-English. We perform desegmentation using SMT and propose a simple yet efficient modification of postordering. We also show that Turkish morphology and word order can be handled in a fully-automatic manner with only a small loss of BLEU.
