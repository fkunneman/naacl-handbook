In this paper, we discuss the human thematic fit judgement correlation task in the context of real-valued vector space word representations. Thematic fit is the extent to which an argument fulfils the selectional preference of a verb given a role: for example, how well ``cake'' fulfils the patient role of ``cut''.  In recent work, systems have been evaluated on this task by finding the correlations of their output judgements with human-collected judgement data.  This task is a representation-independent way of evaluating models that can be applied whenever a system score can be generated, and it is applicable wherever predicate-argument relations are significant to performance in end-user tasks. Significant progress has been made on this cognitive modeling task, leaving considerable space for future, more comprehensive types of evaluation.
