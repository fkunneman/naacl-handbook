This article presents the DOCAL system for document alignment, which took part in the WMT 2016 shared task on bilingual document alignment. The system is meant to offer a portable solution for varied document alignment scenarios, from parallel to comparable corpora, with minimal deployment effort. Its main goal is to provide an optimal balance between alignment precision and recall using minimal resources and adaptation across alignment scenarios. We describe and discuss the performance of the system in the recalloriented shared task.
